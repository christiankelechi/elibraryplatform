throughout the process\nIn loving memory of my grandfather who inspired me to share my passion knowledge and stories  \nwith others\n Heather VanCura\nIn loving memory of my father Hamilton His encouragement early on got me on the path of helping \ndevelopers in their careers To my wife Karina who supported me during all the craziness of my career \nTo my friends and mentees and also my daughters Juliana and Lara Everything in this book I learned \nwith you To my longtime friend and coauthor Heather you know this book would not exist without you\n Bruno SouzaForeword\nAn individual persons career is shaped by many turning points These turning points are often \nencounters either with other people with particular tools or technologies or even with ideas More \noften than not those moments only become apparent in hindsight But the ability to recognize those \nmoments when they happen or shortly afterward turns out to be an important career skill One \nsuch moment early in my career was when I first met Heather VanCura It was at an early JavaOne \nconference I had just started taking my first steps into the careerbroadening world of open standards \nHeather was also early in her career but had already started working with the Java Community Process  \nJCP This particular event was the first awarding of the JCP Star Specification  Spec  Lead program \nA Spec Lead is a role Its a person who leads a team that produces a specification for a part of the \nJava platform I point to this event as a turning point in my career because it encapsulates all three \nparts of this important book first learn and practice technical skills second get involved and third \ncreate impact As youll learn by reading the distilled wisdom from the many colleagues Heather and \nBruno have interviewed in this book the three parts are all a process not a destination During your \ncareer you continually learn more technical skills continually get more involved in existing and new \ncommunities and continually create impact That first JCP Star Spec Lead event was a turning point \nfor me for the following reasons I was working on technical skills then I eventually became a Spec \nLead and then became a Star Spec Lead and ended up stewarding a community that had a positive \nimpact on our industry The stories of the individuals profiled in this book follow a similar progression \nBy reading and applying the learnings in this book you can too\nThis book arrives at a historically important moment for careers in general and Information Technology  \nIT careers specifically Over the over 25 years of my career Ive learned that experienced and expert \ndevelopers are hard to impress The more experience you have the more you can really say Ive seen \nit all before  This current Artificial Intelligence  AI moment is different Not everyone Ive talked to \nis actually impressed  but they all agree that the current AI moment is different and significant This \nspeaks well for the first part of the book Y oull learn to push yourself outside of your comfort zone \nhow to discern which new technologies to absorb and which to skim and how to be intentional in \nassembling your invisible college of fellow developers into a support network In this hyperaccelerated \nAIcharged moment these metaskills are more important than ever\nOnce you build a process for keeping the skills fresh the second part will show you how to find an \naudience for them Experienced developers know that software development is a cooperative game \nY ou cant do it on your own Y ou must join your talents to a community I have personally benefited \nenormously from applying the lessons in this section In my case I applied the lessons before Heather \nand Bruno collected them in a book but I can attest they worked for me and am confident theyll \nwork for you tooFinally the last part is where it all comes together At Microsoft we have three core leadership principles\nbromides create clarity generate energy and deliver success The third part of the book is all about \ndelivering success both for your community and for yourself By the time you get to applying this \npart in your career you will understand your own individual actions will have a bigger impact when \nthey are delivered downstream by other actors Y ou will have learned that your own actions influence \nothers and you are able to benevolently wield that influence to create value\nHeather and Bruno have created an accessible book distilling a careers worth of advice from many \nindividuals each independently successful Y ou can think of it like many lifetimes worth of success \nright in your hand\nEd Burns\nPrincipal architect for Java Microsoft\nEds book Secrets of the Rock Star Programmers

and just as many on careers but there is no guide or roadmap \nfor moving in a technical career from junior developer to senior developer As experts working in \nthe software development industry with over 20 years of experience each this is one of the most \ncommon requests that we receive from developers asking for advice and guidance This book provides \nthat guide along with examples and stories from our global careers working with developers from \nall parts of the world\nWhen we decided in 2021 that we wanted to author a book together it was a conversation that \ndeveloped organically and started with a discussion on how to create a more engaging online social \nnetworking event for developers We had already been working together in the community for over \ntwo decades and we shared many experiences both together and separately many of them in the Java \ncommunity ecosystem We both shared during our conversations that we wanted to author a book \nAlmost immediately our thoughts went to sharing some of the career stories from developers we have \nworked with over the course of our careers We worked together at Sun Microsystems for a brief time \nand for most of our careers we have worked in adjacent roles in the Java User Group  JUG  global \ncommunities in the Java Community Process  JCP program and at various software development \nconferences all over the world During these activities what we see is the influence that participation \nhas on the careers of these developers During this time we have both had the opportunity to interact \nand share our learnings with thousands of developers We both share a passion for developers \ncommunities and technology and enjoy seeing and sharing the successes of those three passions \ncoming together for greater impact\nIn this book we will share how you can advance your technical career from a junior or midlevel \ndeveloper to a senior developer We will share the steps you will take on this journey based on our \nexperiences working with developers in over 80 countries as they navigated their careers across the \ncontinents of Africa Asia Australia Europe and South and North America Along the way we will share \nsome interesting career stories from developers working in some of the largest employers as examples\nWe are excited to have this opportunity to guide you on the way to achieving your career goals and \nenjoying career success By the end of this book you will have gained the knowledge you need to \nclearly develop a plan for your career progression\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for anyone who wants to advance in their technical career no matter their level but \nspecifically for a junior to midlevel technical professional engineer developer or architect who wants \nto move from a junior to a more senior level and excel in their professional lifePreface xii\nWhat this book covers\nThis book is divided into three main parts each having a few chapters to help you fulfill the aim of \nadvancing your technical career Heres a brief overview of what each part covers\n Part 1 The Basics Learn and Practice Technical Skills  Career growth in the technology world \ninvolves being great at a technical level Although the technical side is not everything and \nsometimes not even the thing that will make your career grow it is needed to be part of the \ngame Part 1  will help you go deep into the technical side and get you ready to advance your \ncareer faster and farther\n Part 2 Get Involved Participate in the Community  Although developing your technical skills \nis a great step to have an amazing career you need to go beyond technical skills Software \ndevelopment is a team effort and being able to work together with others is a required skill that \nputs you at the next level If you want to go fast go alone If you want to go farther go together  \nan African proverb Building a career is playing the long game We are not here for the fast \nshort sprint but longterm unique results Part 2 will prepare you for the long run\n Part 3 Create Impact Share and Lead  Now that you know how to establish longterm relationships \nthat will drive your career forward it is time to take the last step position yourself as a leader \nto break all limits in your career growth Part 3  will discuss advanced actions you can take that \nwill differentiate you in the market and transform the lives of people around you\nDeveloper Career Masterplan  involves constant growth a constant feedback loop Y ou learn and then \npractice your  knowledge Y ou can network with your peers and share what you learned This will \nopen more possibilities for learning practicing networking and sharing  This loop will take your \ncareer to great projects and amazing positions Y ou will grow to senior levels and beyond \nAs you can see in the image below the three parts of this book have chapters covering each step of the \nmasterplan Y ou will start with learning and practicing As you progress you will do more networking \nand sharing This masterplan can be applied over and over always resulting in career growth Each \nstep described in detail in the corresponding chapters builds on and reinforces the other steps to \nhelp you build your career path to take you where you want to goPreface\n xiii\nTo get the most out of this book\nTo get started on this journey you need to understand the importance of emotional intelligence or \nEQ how to grow beyond technical skills how to strategically build your technical knowledge and \nthe importance of increasing your visibility\nIn a wellknown Fortune500 company there is an engineering team with a couple of developers who \nstand out for promotion There is a developer who has the best technical skills and a developer who \nhas good technical skills but also is an expert communicator and team playercollaborator Who do \nyou think will receive a promotion Based on the tired media trope of a solo programmer working \nalone in a basement eating pizza most people would think that the developer with the best technical \nskills will receive the promotion However this is not the case The developer with communication \nand collaboration skills alongside the technical skills gets the promotion These are the skills that \nmake up emotional intelligencePreface xiv\nMany academics have written on this topic with diverse ways of measuring and evaluating emotional \nintelligence but to understand the point it is enough for you to know that most employers today \nwould prefer to hire retain and promote a developer who not only has the top technical skills but \nalso a high degree of emotional intelligence Even if that means sacrificing some level of technical \nability when given the choice employers will more often choose the individual with better emotional \nintelligence The one with the best people skills wins Emotional intelligence requires skills that you \ncannot learn from reading a book alone These are skills that require practice and human interaction \nThis is true in technical roles as well as nontechnical roles\nThe World Economic Forum is an international organization that brings together public and private \norganizations for cooperation purposes The Forum engages the foremost political business cultural \nand other leaders of society to shape global regional and industry agendas The World Economic \nForum recently issued The Future of Jobs Report  The report listed the following skills with growing \ndemand through 2025 and beyond\n Critical thinking and analysis\n Problemsolving\n Selfmanagement\n Working with people\n Management and communication of activities\nTake the time to consider and evaluate your level of emotional intelligence Identify areas where you \nneed to grow and look for opportunities to practice your skills While machine learning and artificial \nintelligence will impact development jobs and you must learn to work with them the demand for \ndevelopment jobs will continue to grow and will remain strong even in economically uncertain times\nHow do you grow beyond just technical skills to incorporate emotional intelligence It is easy to think \nthat as a developer you should only be coding It may seem to fit into your predisposed view of how \nyou can advance your career to the next level  to focus on the technical skills that you were hired to \nuse in accomplishing your tasks and projects\nDevelopers cannot expect to write code in isolation and deliver it by throwing it over the wall  or putting \nit in a repository and closing the project Open source and agile methodologies for software development \nhave been just some of the factors that have changed this method of working to deliver software\nThe way to grow beyond the technical and develop your emotional intelligence is to practice with \nothers whether virtually or in person Look for moments to empathize communicate and collaborate \nwith other people Y ou will see your skills develop through repetition and feedbackPreface\n xv\nHow do you choose the right skills to learn Many developers tend to want to learn the newest \ncoolest or shiniest technology Often they will start the process of learning a newer more innovative \ntechnological skill without considering whether it will benefit them in achieving what they really want \nBefore you start spending time learning a recently released technology evaluate why you want to learn \nthat technology or skill Does it align with your goals to advance your career to the next level Is it \nworth the time you will lose learning the skill when you could be spending that time in other areas\nIt is great to learn new things but before you add every modern technology that is popular to your \nlist of skills to learn think about the reason that you want to learn that technology Is it required for \na project you are working on Or do you think it could be used in such a project Or do you see the \npotential for this technology to grow and be useful to you in the future If yes then you should invest \nthe time required to learn it\nEmployers expect developers to be learning on the job and filling skill gaps in technical areas The \nproblems arise when we add every recent technology to our list of skills to learn At that point it can \nbe overwhelming and can lead to procrastination and stagnation The sheer volume of new tools \ntechniques and technologies can trigger the exact opposite of what you are trying to achieve resulting \nin immobility\nTime is finite It is our most precious and valuable commodity as humans Take the time to evaluate \nand consider why you want to learn a new technology before you add it to your career map Y ou can \noften gain visibility by getting involved in projects or areas that are valued by senior management \nPay attention to the projects that your line manager prioritizes Listen to or read reports listen to \npodcasts or read articles where they discuss future directions Communicate your interest in working \nin those areas Learn new skills in those areas Share knowledge that you have in those areas Some \nexcellent ways to share include social media public speaking user groups and networking at industry \nconferences or events\nWhat we have learned in our own career journeys is that sharing builds communities and trust The \nauthors of this book share the common desire to help you advance your technical career and build \nyour trust in us to guide you on your way to a senior developer position Do you have a map ready \nwith some of the areas identified where you need to grow Take some time to think and get clarity on \nthose items before you move on to Part 1  of the

about \nTechnology Quickly and \nContinuously\nSoftware development is a creative and innovative field Although the main concepts last for many \ndecades the applications of those concepts as well as technologies and tools come and go in short \nperiods of time Because of this software developers need the right skills and habits to continuously \nlearn and adapt\nThere is no better way to start a book on technology careers than by going directly into the number \none career problem that you may be facing how to stay uptodate with the fast pace and changes of \nthe technology world\nIn our many talks and presentations around the world the question of how to learn all the new things \nis common angst for technology professionals It is common to find people that reserve several hours \neach day for learning and still feel outdated and unable to catch up To get out of this predicament \nthe best solution is to stop focusing on knowledge and start focusing on skills\nWe therefore bring you this chapter where well unravel the secrets to learning about technology \nconstantly and quickly Y oull learn about the following main topics in this chapter\n Knowledge versus skills\n Finding focus and priorities\n Applying justintime learning\n Practicing deliberately to learn a tech\n Implementing important good habits\nLets dive right inThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 4\nKnowledge versus skills\nDevelopers around the  world ask us a quite common question How can we keep up with current \neverchanging technology Developers spend many hours every week trying to do exactly that learn \nabout technologies frameworks APIs languages and tools that pop up all the time hoping that this \nwill amount to keeping up to date with technology\nThe problems with this approach are multiple\n There are too many things happening at the same time and it is impossible to know which \nones are the most important\n Trying to learn many things at once is confusing and you end up feeling tired and overwhelmed \nby the number of things that need to be done\n Forcing yourself to spend many hours a day doing something that seems neverending is a \nrecipe for frustration\nBut there is one thing that gets the crown for being the most frustrating\n Learning many things that you will not apply right now is not only superficial but the knowledge \nwill neither last nor will it be useful for long\nWhen you learn a new skill think about how you will apply that skill Actively search for a way to \nincorporate your new skill into your daytoday coding projects Using the skills you gain right away will \nhelp you to build the muscle memory for the new skill and assimilate it into your library of knowledge\nHave you ever spent hours learning something that you are not using in a project right now and a \nfew months later when you need it you remember next to nothing and have to refresh  it And does \nthat refreshing  feel like almost having to relearn everything There is a reason for that feeling and it is \nthe difference between knowledge and skills\nAn effective way to think about knowledge is that it is a collection of memories that are disconnected \nfrom each other  Because they are disconnected it takes some time for you to remember those things \nwhen you need them And once you recover one memory it does not help you recover other memories \nThis is like learning about the history of bicycles and how they were invented Although you may love \nbikes it is hard to remember the names and dates and who did what There is a better way\nHave you ever heard the popular saying that goes like this once you learn how to ride a bicycle you \nnever forget  This is because riding a bicycle is not knowledge its a skill An effective way to think \nabout skills is that they are collections of memories that are connected to each other Once you recover \none of those memories they all come together  and are accessed in a much faster way by your brain\nThat is why once you acquire the skill you just sit on the bicycle and go Y ou do not need to remember \neach fact about riding a bike It just comes  to you without effort The most important thing about skills \nfor you to keep in mind is that although you can acquire knowledge by reading or listening you can \nonly develop skills by doing  There is no amount of reading listening watching videos or following Knowledge versus skills\n 5\namazing tutorials that will ever get you to ride a bicycle The only way is to go down to the park and \ntry fall try again and eventually do it\nThis is the same for every developer skill that you want to master To really learn something you \nmust do things instead of simply studying to acquire the knowledge \nWhen you write your CV or resume or prepare your LinkedIn profile do you list in it all the books \nyou read and Y ouTube videos you watched Do you list all the knowledge you have Or do you put \nmore focus on the projects you worked on and the experiences you acquired\nEven when just starting you will clearly be better off including everything you did even if they were \njust personal and volunteer projects because at the end of the day it is your experience  and skills  that \nreally matter\nWe started this chapter by talking about how developers spend a lot of time trying to keep up to date \nso does the discussion around skills just make it worse We must spend time keeping up to date but \nthe outcome we desire is to gain more skills As we gain skills we must still do our daytoday things \nso it will take more  time not less\nSometimes in order to do things you need to develop a strategy for doing so This reminds us of a \ndeveloper we know named Maryna Savchenko She is a software engineer based in Germany and \na true believer in software craftsmanship clean code and TDD She finds intellectual fulfillment in \naccomplishing hard tasks and is passionate about acquiring and improving skills When we asked \nher to share a story with us about learning continuously and shaping her career she shared that what \nreally helped her in her learning journey is a book entitled A Mind for Numbers  by Barbara Oakley \nBy reading this book she figured out her own learning framework  Understanding how she learns \nbest helped her to avoid frustration and keep being motivated during learning complex topics \nUnderstanding the best way to learn new skills and gain experience by doing is a crucial step as you \ncontinue your path for learning Lets hear some more from Mayrna\nAfter leaving Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics with a bachelors degree in computer \nengineering I did not work as a software engineer I was told that I do not have it  And I strongly \nbelieved that for some time When I was offered a job in application support at a software development \ncompany I was glad I worked hard I learned accounting by myself to understand enterprise resource \nplanning systems better and passed four certifications only to realize that I was learning the wrong thing \nI learned the hard way how focusing on the right thing matters Why was it wrong Well that technology \n1C Enterprise was limited to a number of countries Ukraine Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan I could \nnot reuse my knowledge and working for a company with headquarters in Russia was not right after \nRussianUkrainian War started in 2014 In addition to that I was making less and less money every \nday because of inflation I was paying full price for my wrong decision and for listening too much to \nother people At this point in time I did the first analysis of the Java ecosystem and thought that it may \nbe a good way forward In the meantime my husband and I decided to move to Poland from Ukraine \nI realized at this time that I needed to think hard about what to do and what to learn next After one \nmore analysis of the market and technologies I was sure that Java was a good choice and decided to The Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 6\nbecome a Java programmer Finding a job abroad without relevant experience is not an easy task You \nneed to be better than local candidates and prove it In my case I needed to prove it to myself also So I \nneeded to learn a lot of things such as the language itself frameworks build tools testing frameworks \ndatabases design patterns and so on In the beginning I was very slow ineffective and overwhelmed \nSo I googled how other people learn Many said they just learn and that is it After some searching I \nfound Barbara Oakleys book and it was full of the advice I needed I also discovered a rich and diverse \nsoftware engineering community including Java champions Microsoft MVP people experienced software \nengineers techno bloggers and tech educators It gave me an understanding of what I was doing wrong \nand I started to believe in my plan But looking for a software developer job in Poland was not successful \nfor me I had only one technical interview When I tried to send my CV to Germany I realized how \ngeography matters From sending 13 CVs I got 6 responses 2 onsite interviews and 1 job offer And \nwe were on our way to a new country In Germany I still needed to learn a lot to level up as well as the \nGerman language Having a learning framework gave me the right tools and confidence to proceed Last \nyear I got promoted to midlevel and started blogging  httpssavchenkotech  Now I am \nliving in Munich and on my way to improving my career \nAs Mayrnas story illustrates sometimes you have to find your inspiration and curiosity to continuously \nlearn Next we will discuss how to find focus and priorities to help us identify the skills we need to \nkeep up to date\nFinding focus and priorities\nConnected to  the how to keep up with current everchanging technology  question that we looked at \nin the previous section there is a followup that we also hear all the time Which technologies are \nimportant to learn today and which ones should we prioritize\nThis question is a recognition that there simply is not enough time to acquire every skill so what do \nyou choose\nThere is a simple answer to that Choose to learn something that you need to apply right now \nIt may sound simple but it makes sense If execution is what develops your skills then if you prioritize \nlearning about something that you need to use immediately you will go ahead and use it which will \ndevelop your skill This is the best way to get yourself to do the skill the fastest This is simple but it \nis not very helpful is it\nImagine this Y ou must do something at work and your boss tells you to learn and apply it In this \ncase what we just discussed could be the right answer However that leaves you at the mercy of what \nyour company wants you to do and someone elses ideas of what is important Not a good strategy \nfor an awesome career is it\nFor you to take control of your careerthe theme of this bookyou need to proactively go after the \nthings that make a difference to you For that you will need to focus and choose what matters to youApplying justintime learning\n 7\nAnd immediately when you hear that you may feel a tiny bit of anxiety pop up in your head There \nare so many options to choose from\n What if I choose the wrong thing\n What if the thing I choose is not the best thing\n What if I miss the important things\n What if things change\nIf you feel like this maybe it is because you think that the focus is the technology or the tool that you \nwill spend time mastering and developing the skills for Y ou may be thinking that the focus is for \nexample on Java instead of Go or Ruby\nBut that definition of focus is too narrow and not very useful for your career Choosing an area of \nyour focus is not about choosing a technology or a tool much less a framework or an API Choosing \na focus is choosing the problem you want to solve In a way choosing a problem is a much more \nspecific and narrow focus\nFor example you can focus on solving the very pressing problem of achieving high performance for \nlarge scalable Javabased finance applications in the cloud\nThis is a very precise problem to solve It seems much more specific than focusing on Java or the cloud\nHowever the tools knowledge and skills needed to achieve high performance are actually many and \nvaried Y ou will need to know about Java tools cloud tools performance tools financial concepts \nscalable architectures and so much more\nWell this seems too much to learn Arent we back to the problem of lack of focus If you keep the \nproblem in mind then no It is the problem that will help you keep your focus\nIn our example you dont need to learn or keep up to date with everything in Java just the parts that \nfocus on performance Theres no need to follow every single tool that shows up in the cloud Y ou will \nfocus on the ones that give you an edge on the scalability needed in the financial world\nFinding your focus is finding an interesting problem to solve that you are passionate about In the \nnext section we will introduce a concept to help you\nApplying justintime learning\nHere is where the  rubber hits the road Once  you know a problem even if it is a broad idea of what \nit is you have a direction to go learn research and dive deep How can we mention broad  and deep  \nin the same sentence and not make that contradictory This is what we call justintime learning  \nwhich is a twostep process Let us discuss each step briefl y in the following subsectionsThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 8\nStep 1  Have a broad vision of the market\nThe first step is to have a broad view of the problem you are going after the tools technologies \ncompanies people and more\nOnce you lean toward a problem or direction even if it is fuzzy and just defined in general broad \nterms surround yourself with related information Y our goal is to go broad to know what exists\nThis will be scary because the more you know it exists the more you will feel there are too many \nthings you do not know That is called the DunningKruger effect  and it is a cognitive bias that you \ncan learn to control\nFigure 11  DunningKruger effect\nTo go broad use the following techniques\n Follow people related to your focus on Twitter and LinkedIn\n Search for technologies and projects in that general area\n Talk and connect with people ask questions and pay attention\n Attend online and inperson meetups and events\n Subscribe to bloggers in that space\nHere you are looking to have a broad view of the landscape get a feeling about the terminology the \nmost mentioned and used tools the people that are shaping that area and what they think\nThis is a superficial view but you should also look a little below the surface When you hear about \ntools and concepts you do not know a quick Google search will tell you what they are and what they \nare useful for\nKeep this in mind you need to know that things exist their general usefulness what problems \nthey solve what problems they create and a sense of their popularity  Y ou can use your memory \na file on your computer a notebook or even tools such as Anki to maintain your general view of your \nApplying justintime learning\n 9\nproblem space This is knowledge and it is particularly important that you are continuously aware \nof your problem domain\nOne crucial point this seems very timeconsuming right If you agree it is because you are thinking \nabout going deep and spending hours researching every day But remember that is not the point \nbut rather a superficial understanding Y ou should be aware and connected Y ou  should be paying \nattention to your area A few minutes a day or when the opportunity arises is more than enough for \nyou to build that general idea\nWe can almost hear you say  This superficial idea will not help me learn things  And you are right \nThe objective of being broad is to know what exists Then you apply step 2\nStep 2  Go deep when you are ready to apply\nNow that you know what  exists look for opportunities to apply interesting things in your daytoday \ncoding and development projects so you can experiment with this approach This can take many forms\nLook for opportunities to experiment with some of those technologies or ideas in your current project \nEven if your project will not use these ideas in production there are many opportunities to experiment \nwith prototypes and test cases as tools for you to be more productive or to build a tool for the team\nPay attention to what is going on in your company Y ou may hear of projects or proofs of concept \nthat are being considered customers that need a new solution or internal projects that need to be \nimplemented Volunteering to discuss and participate in some of those may give you a chance to apply \nthe technologies you are interested in\nFind things outside of work that you are interested in Applying skills at work is your best option but \nsometimes the opportunities are harder to come by and you may need to look elsewhere Personal \nprojects volunteer projects for a nonprofit or open source projects are all good options\nIn all cases when you see an opportunity to apply your knowledge this is the time to go deep with \njustintime learning Do a deep dive into how to use that particular technology or tool Spend a few \nhours during the week creating a small prototype getting something up and running Y our goal here \nis to get up to speed with it as fast as possible and go as deep as possible in that time\nThe objective is not to become an overnight expert but to be able to apply that new idea to a real project\nWhat will justintime learning do to your skill acquisition process\nFirst it will give you a broad vision of what exists and what matters to your focus area That in turn \nwill allow you to identify opportunities to apply that technology\nSecond once you find a real opportunity you will go deep by learning and applying immediately what \nyou learned and that will give you the skills you need to advance\nThat begs a new question how do we practiceThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 10\nPracticing deliberately to learn a technology\nIf you ask me what the  third question that we get all the time is it is How can I be a better developer \nAnd again the answer is simple enough practice\nIf what matters are the skills you only acquire by doing it follows that the more you do practice the \nskill the better you get at it\nAgain the answer is simple but not very useful Because you are probably thinking about your reality \nwhere you barely have time to do your work and what you must do you can barely keep up with all \nthat goes around you How can you spend hours and hours practicing something\nThis indeed is a good point\nFirst you do not need to spend hours and hours practicing Second as much as possible you should \npractice by doing something real and that in most cases means doing your work\nThere is a third point too If this is your  career should you strive to be the best you can be\nThat is not a rhetorical question For many people their job is just a job And that is totally OK If this \ndescribes you do not feel bad that you are not interested in putting your best effort into becoming \nbetter All you need is to be good enough to hold a decent job And at the end of the day you go home \nto your family hobbies and your life\nThere are many developers whose lives and hobbies are more interesting than their jobs And they \nare better  at their hobbies than they are at their jobs At this moment Bruno interjects I am one of \nthem   I am better  at speaking engaging audiences and building communities than I am at being a \nsoftware developer I now spend my time helping developers with their careers\nAs a Java developer since the earliest days of the technology Bruno took part in some of the largest \nJava projects in Brazil and gained extensive experience in large projects in the government finance \nand service industries  While doing this his passion was actually communities Slowly he combined \nhis developer work with community work and started to participate in Java open source communities \nand projects such as the Java Community Process  JCP program the Open Source Initiative  OSI \nthe innovationfocused Campus Party Institute The Developers Conference and much more\nSo although he started as a Java developer he eventually made his community hobby his main work \nand he helped to found SouJava  Sociedade de Usurios da Tecnologia Java Java Technology Users \nSociety  one of the worlds largest Java User Groups  JUGs  and became a leader of the Worldwide \nJUGs Community helping the organization of hundreds of JUGs worldwide\nThe fact that I was able to turn my hobby into a fulltime career is testimony that it can be done\nBut if you do want to be the best technical person you can be then you must practice And for you \nto not  spend all the time you have available practicing here are a few things you need to know about \npracticing deliberatelyImplementing important good habits\n 11\n Deliberate practice is practicing with a purpose  Y ou must practice with a specific purpose \nin mind Just sitting down at the computer and hacking away for a few hours is fun and you \nshould do it because it is fun But that is not practicing deliberately Define what you want to \nimprove by when and what you are going to do to get there\n Deliberate practice is focused  Choose a specific skill you want to improve and work deeply \non it Focus on the specific thing you need to improve and be better at Practicing is improving \none specific skill at a time\n Deliberate practice is intense  Define some exercises that you can focus on with intensity for \n30 minutes to 1 hour A clever idea is to use the Pomodoro Technique and execute one or two \npomodoros  25 minutes each Another technique is to use the rule of three do three focused \nbursts with a few minutes or even a couple of hours between them\n Deliberate practice is daily practice  In terms of skills nothing beats consistency It is better \nto practice for 15 minutes every day than to concentrate 45 hours at the weekend Set a daily \npractice time use some inactive time during the day to review past practices and commit \nyourself to do a small effort even 5 minutes can make a substantial difference Anything that \nhelps you practice daily will give you better and more consistent results\n Deliberate practice uses proven methods  As much as possible follow existing tested practices \nLearn how to type on the keyboard using proven methods Practice code katas that have been \ncreated specifically to improve development skills If you cannot find or do not know a proven \nmethod for something talk with friends or colleagues who are more advanced than you and \nsee whether you find some common techniques that worked for them\nPracticing proven methods daily in a focused way and with intensity especially when combined with \nwork can at the same time reduce the number of hours invested and give better results\nY ou will encounter roadblocks along the way but you can remind yourself to make learning a part of \nyour career path and journey To be successful in your technical career you need to consistently be \nlearning Consistency with a manageable amount of learning is the key to success in making learning \na part of your lifestyle\nBut how can you keep the consistency Y ou keep consistency by making learning a habit That is why \nwe need to build a few good habits\nImplementing important good habits\nY our brain is always trying to optimize the paths and build the neurological structures the brain \nequivalent of muscles to allow you to do what you need to survive So it looks for repetitive things \nthat you do and it tries to codify those repetitive tasks into structures that are easier to access faster \nto execute and require less energy\nThat is why we are creatures of habit Most of what you do every day are habits or routines codified \nin our brains so we can access them easily and quicklyThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 12\nWhen those structures help you move forward and achieve your goals we call them good habits \nThey are good for you When they prevent you from advancing hinder your results slow you down \nor cause you harm they are vices or bad habits\nEither way your brain loves to just run with them\nThere are a few good habits that can really change your life We have listed a few steps that we think \nare particularly important for you to create good habits\nTake action\nWhen there is something that you would like to do get in the habit of taking small actions Taking \naction is the hardest thing for us to do and not taking action is the basis for terrible vices such as \nprocrastination and perfectionism\nTry to take small actions on things you want to do Do you want to participate in an open source \nproject That seems big and fearsome Take a small action such as accessing the page of the project \nand looking at it for a few minutes Overcoming the inertia of things you want to do will help you do \nthings even when you do not feel like it\nWrite every day\nOur brains can be cluttered with thoughts and ideas To help you think better your brain needs to \nexternalize Speaking with someone or writing about it will help you clarify your thinking\nThat is why developers need to write code every day focusing on solving problems Take a few \nminutes every day to write about a problem It can be writing the text for a blog or article or  it could \nbe more technical and be code and pseudocode to explain or test an idea It can also be just having a \nconversation Doing this daily will help you think better and be more articulate\nCreate routines to get yourself started\nY ou know when you start a sports activity your coach will do some exercises that are always the \nsame Things like stretching and warming up exercises This primes your body and gets it ready for \nthe activity ahead Y our brain needs that too\nCreate small routines to start working Start coding Or any important activity that you need to be \nvery sharp and focused\nA startup routine is a series of small steps such as saying the following to yourself  before I start \ncoding I will do these things\n Sit down\n Put away things that are not neededImplementing important good habits\n 13\n Drink a glass of water\n Close the email\n Open the IDE\nTry to repeat the same steps with purpose every time you start coding It will prime your brain and \nget it ready to focus on the task at hand\nPlan your week\nWe live in a world that is full of distractions and we combat information overload coming from all \naspects of our lives We are busy and it becomes difficult and overwhelming to achieve the things that \nmatter to us If we focus on the things that are most important to us and that we want to accomplish \nwe not only gain focus but we also become happier and more productive This is the idea behind the \nThree Big Rocks concept It is a concept that can help us to prioritize our time\nThe Three Big Rocks concept is mentioned by Stephen Covey in his book The Seven Habits of \nHighly Productive People  which can be found on Amazon at httpswwwamazoncom\ndp0743269519r efolpopfrediraod1 \nIn this book there is a time management expert giving a seminar to a roomful of people He provides \na demonstration of this concept by taking a mason jar and putting large rocks into the jar and asking \nthe audience whether or not the jar is full The attendees indicate that the jar does appear to be full \nThe speaker then adds smaller rocks into the jar fitting them in between the large rocks and turns \nagain to the audience to ask whether the jar is full The audience is not sure which way to answer at \nthis point so he adds some sand to the jar to fill in even more of the space between the large rocks \nand the pebbles While pausing and asking the audience again to confirm whether the jar is full he \nthen pours water into the jar until it is at the point of overflowing The speaker then asks what the \nobjective of this exercise is Some people may answer that no matter how busy or full your schedule \nmay be there is always room to put more things into your schedule however the point of the Three \nBig Rocks example is that if you dont put the big rocks in first you will never get them in at all\nThis is a simplification of the concept and there is much more that you could learn and apply but this \ngives you an overview of the main idea behind the term three big rocks  To implement this concept \nat the start of the week make sure you decide on your three big rocks for the week They are the three \nmost important tasks you have for the week the ones where if you complete them you will feel that \nyour week was worth it\nSchedule time to do them To choose the three big rocks look at your longterm goals and make sure \nyou choose the things that move you in the right directionThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 14\nDeploy habits\nThose are just a few examples you can implement To help you deploy those habits in your life \nremember to start small Y our brain will resist any substantial changes\nHabits are implanted faster if you succeed than if you fail So it is better to create a writing habit by \nwriting for 5 minutes every day and succeeding every day than trying to start writing for 1 hour a \nday and failing after a few tries\nAlso daily habits are easier to implement because they become ingrained faster To implement a \nhabit experts say you need around 66 repetitions to create new pathways in the brain That amounts \nto 3 to 4 weeks if you do 2 or 3 repetitions a day So it is better to do something you can repeat every \nday multiple times a day depending on the habit That is another reason why you should focus on \nstarting small\nOther techniques you can use to help you keep the motivation to implement powerful habits include \ndoing things together with friends in a community it increases your commitment and organizing \nyour day or your habit to be easier for you to do than for you not to do making it easier for you to \ntake action\nBuilding small habits or routines will help you stay focused and consistent and will lay the groundwork \nfor you to advance fast in your career\nHeather interjects here as an enthusiastic learner who enjoys having a variety of responsibilities \nI have found joy in being able to consistently bring new aspects and skills into my life and career by \ndeveloping habits that set me up to be successful \nAs the senior director and chairperson of the JCP program in her role Heather is responsible for the \nleadership of the community and chairing the JCP Executive Committee She has led and participated \nin several initiatives with the community including JUGs as part of her role such as JCP next Adopt \na JSR Hack Days and Java in Education and is an internationally renowned public speaker at software \ndevelopment events all over the world\nShe says the work that I do to engage the Java developer community on a global basis is broad and \nvast  it could become overwhelming to think about all of the areas where I could focus I have found \nthat by incorporating habits to focus my time it becomes energizing and exciting to always be evolving \nand learning In order to establish consistency and focus to accomplish great things in the community \nI have incorporated certain habits that are part of my routine For example every Sunday I review my \ncalendar for the week and block out time for my priorities for the week I also identify those priorities \nand set aside time to prepare for the most important meetings of my week I then identify a list of tasks \nthat should be accomplished during the week My week also includes time for creation learning and \nnetworking I have set habits that allow me to build these activities into my week For instance I rise early \nand take time early in my day to focus on creation or writing and I plan most of my meetings following \nthat time in my midmorning hours I incorporate some form of exercise in the middle of my day and \nmy afternoons are for doing tasks on my list I also try to leave Fridays open for new initiatives or projects Interview\n 15\nthat I might be working on as well as learning and networking Setting up my habits to include these \nareas that I have identified as priorities for me has allowed me to grow and expand my career and my \nareas of influence over time\nTips for learning new skills\nAssess and focus Y ou need to identify the skills or knowledge you are missing  be as specific and \nfocused as possible to narrow down the area to learn Look for skills and knowledge you need to \nlearn right now\nStudy and review the skills to build and deploy your habits Have a plan and stick to it Look for ways to \ncelebrate and reward your success along the way Share and communicate those wins to other people\nGet feedback  and check your progress Validate that you are on the identified path Adjust your \nlearning process and plan as necessary Ask for feedback from others to check your knowledge and \nlearning progress\nInterview\nRafael del Nero\nWe would like to share with you the experience of Rafael del Nero working at Mastercard as an example\nQ Tell us a little bit about the current role that you have at Mastercard What do you do What kind of \nthings do you work with How interesting are the projects that you work on Tell us a little bit about that\nA Im a senior software engineer at Mastercard and my work is not exactly related to business \nrequirements implementation The project weve got is to triple our current cloud project thats deployed \nonly in the US to other continents We are doing a lot of DevOps work and configuration work for \nour website and my daytoday work is on that\nIm going to give you some examples of the work Ive done Some of the activities that Ive been doing \nhave been migrating Java 8 to Java 11 Another example would be adding partition jobs and outscaling \nIve generally been doing work to enable our services to be deployed in other continents and we have \nto make them at least a little bit more reliable by adding outscaling and basic microservices features\nIm not doing a lot of coding But even in my last role in the last company I was working for I \nwasnt doing a lot of coding because as I said sometimes for developers the scenario of software \ndevelopment is changing Y ou are far more of a software engineer rather than a developer who \ndevelops code I dont see that very much anymore in the market and thats happening because of the \ncloud era Services nowadays are deployed in an isolated way Its just a natural thing that happens in \ntechnology As technology evolves and gets more mature the work changes as well Nowadays for \nexample we dont have one big unit We have microservices and they communicate with each other \nusing investment brokers and so on Ive also done a lot of work with message brokers so its just \nsoftware engineering workThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 16\nQ Tell us a little bit about your projects Y ou have the Java challenges project Can you tell us a little \nbit about that how that got started and the results youre having with it\nA Y es The Java challenges started five years ago\nBasically they are Java quizzes They are carefully designed to help Java developers really understand \nJava features They resemble the certification questions but are more useful than those questions \nI carefully produced them to really push developers to understand the main Java features such as \npolymorphism threads and inheritance and new features such as records the new switch case \npattern matching and virtual threads There are Java challenges for all of those features and its fun \nfor developers to understand and master those features\nAs for how it started well it started with Bruno If you didnt motivate me to share my knowledge maybe \nI would never have done it When I saw your talk on TDC you were saying that it was possible In one \ntalk of yours someone mentioned mentorship and I said  Man this guy is crazy How would Bruno \nor anyone else need a mentorship  Then you answered and then I said  OK Maybe thats possible \nThen I started the mentorship program with you but before starting the mentorship with you just \nwith that talk I saw on TDC you had already made me believe that it was possible By going through \nyour talk I gave two talks at my job because I thought  OK I believe Bruno He said its possible so \nIm going to do it   Y ou were able to empower me to give my first talk and that was great because after \nI gave those talks people were looking differently at me and telling me  Rafael I can really see that \nyouve grown a lot   just because I delivered the talks\nWhen I saw the guy asking that question I said  Oh this guys crazy How can Bruno give mentorship  \nThen you put up your website and I said  OK Im going to write that down and do the mentorship \nwith Bruno   At that moment I decided that I was going to do the mentorship\nAnyway I learned a lot from you and then I started sharing knowledge on Twitter more consistently \nbecause I wasnt doing that very consistently before I had maybe five posts on my blog  I didnt have \na lot  but then I learned that consistency was so important with you so I said  OK Ill commit to \nthat I will start generating content regarding how to have fewer bugs or how to create highquality code   \nI started creating some blog posts regarding that\nI did a design pattern post on Twitter and Y olande retweeted this design pattern article and I got lots of \nviews I wanted to say thanks to her and then I asked you Bruno  How can I thank Yolande How can \nI thank the Java community for that  Y ou said  Create content for her   I thought  OK What can I do \nThen I saw that she was working on a project called 100 Days of Java  I thought to myself  OK I really \nlike to explore those Java features and I also like games and I d like to create some Java code challenges \nI will create one daily challenge   and thats what I have done I created one Java challenge every day \nand I shared them with Y olande and the Java community \nThat was an amazing way to help her to share Java knowledge and it helped me a lot as well because \nI gained so much visibility In fact I had no idea that I was getting so much visibility but when I had \nthe Java challenge of going to JavaOne in 2017 a lot of people already knew me A lot of people came Interview\n 17\nto me and said  Oh I know you I know your job I know your work   I was impressed because a lot of \npeople knew me because of the Java challenges\nThe consistency was a gamechanger Sometimes one simple idea when combined with a strong will \nand consistency can be a gamechanger I was consistent with the Java challenges and that opened a \nlot of doors for me It opened the door to give a talk at JavaOne That then opened the door to writing \na book That then opened doors to great videos and great articles and I also wrote a lot of articles for \nJavaWorld and IDG InfoWorld because of the Java challenges Its all down to one idea motivation \nand encouragement  you know there are lots of variables but at the start was the empowerment of a \nmentor thats so important Bruno was my mentor  he is my mentor Maybe without that I wouldnt \nhave been empowered enough Maybe I wouldnt be doing what Im doing I was focusing so much \non technical knowledge that I forgot everything else What happened was that a lot of other people \nwere getting promoted and I wasnt\nQ What were the results for you of the consistency the practice and the challenges What happened \nin your career after that\nA Well what happened was that I got visibility and it was far easier to get interviews for example \nA lot of companies were sending me messages on LinkedIn to do interviews and when I arrived in \nIreland things were easier There were doors open already\nFor example through SouJava I was able to meet the Java group leader when I was touring Sao Paulo \nThat opened doors for me because I already knew him In the first week I remember I went out with \nthe two Barrys and we had a chat and it was fun Then I could help him build their website and it \nwas great because I was mentoring a German lady and I was practicing my English It was good to \nhave these doors open when I came here for the first time\nWhen I was sharing my knowledge what happened is that I gained trust People trusted me even if \nthey had never talked to me before I had their trust Barry Alistair the JUG leader told me  Hey \nRafael There is a group of Brazilians there Go say hi to them   I went over to say hi and one of those \nBrazilians  Rodrigo Rodriguez  knew me already he had seen my content He said  Hey Are you \nworking  I said  No Im looking for a job   Then he said  Man there is a company thats really good \nto get started with   I went to talk to a friend of his and then I got recommended to this company \nand then things worked out\nSo why is sharing so important Y ou gain trust Even if people have never talked to you before people \ntrust you He only recommended me because he saw the content I was sharing and I didnt even need \nto tell him anything He just said  I will recommend you   What happened was great because when \nyou recommend people in most companies you get some money He got some money I got the job \nand so it was a winwin for everyoneThe Secret to Learning about Technology Quickly and Continuously 18\nQ One of the things you mentioned here was practicing and consistency Can you talk a little bit \nabout how practice was important for you to learn new skills especially because one of the things \nthat you do is that you help other people practice How important is practicing to improve and learn \nthings and improve skills\nA Well its highly important Practice is the key to mastery Y ou can do only moderatequality work \nif you do it once in a while but you can create a masterpiece if you do deliberate practice Thats why \nits so important to build consistency and its hard to build consistency because there are days that \nyou dont really want to do whatever youre committed to doing But on those days when you push \nyourself those are the days that you build up mastery\nIts extremely important to do deliberate practice in whatever skill you want to really build up In the \ncase of the Java challenges nowadays Im able to create better Java code challenges Its important to be \nconsistent because thats how you build up your confidence and when you build up your confidence \nyou are able to do much more\nAnd not only that when you are consistent and do whatever you plan to do for a long period of time \nyou will excel in that skill If you do something only once in a while youll be only average in that \nskill Y ou wont excel Y ou wont gain mastery of your work But if you are consistent for a long period \nof time and you do what you need to do even when you dont feel like it you can build really big \nthings And thats hard to do because you are fighting against your own mind\nQ Y ou help people to become better developers I know you you help them with the Java challenges \nproject and you help them to learn new things and be better Whats your biggest suggestion for \npeople to improve their skills\nA Deliberate practice is the key to the mastery of skills  for example writing Writing is a skill that \ntakes time until you get good at it I started writing articles consistently so that I could get better at \nmy writing skills Not only that but I could also improve my writing skills by writing a book\nAs a tip for anyone who wants to be consistent firstly you have to believe that you can get there \nOtherwise you wont even do any of the work because whats the point of doing such hard work for \nnothing The first step for anyone who wants to be consistent is to believe that you can achieve it\nMentors help so much with that because a mentor is someone who has a much broader view than \nyou and that gives you the confidence to believe that its possible A mentor is a tremendous aid to \nhelp you with your confidence\nY oull also have to fight against your own mind because there will be days that you wont be willing \nto do whatever youre committed to doing Y ou have to decide  OK Im going to do that no matter \nwhat   because youre going to have to do those things on the days that you dont feel like it thats \nhard But when you see the big picture and think  OK If I keep doing that I know that I will reap \ngood things   it gets easierSummary\n 19\nIt also gets easier when you start seeing results When you start seeing results thats a boost for your \nmotivation But you have to keep in mind that motivation wont get you all the way Discipline will get \nyou all the way Motivation is a booster that you have at the beginning but what makes you continue is \nnot motivation  its discipline Of course youre going to have some motivation boosters  when you \nsee some results for instance youre going to have a motivation boost  but for most of the process \nyoure going to have to be taking action and not getting immediate results Focus not on the results \nbut on the process and just keep doing it\nThats the hardest part to keep doing the thing you decided to do even when you dont feel like it Its \na war against your own mind Thats the hardest thing about being consistent Staying consistent on \nthose days that you dont feel like it is the hardest thing\nAnd of course do something you enjoy  otherwise its much easier to give up If you do something \nyou like then you feel more motivated but keep in mind that sometimes whatever you choose to \ndo there will be things to do that will be a little bit boring thats OK Sometimes it wont be so easy \n youre going to have to embrace the boredom I embrace the boredom a lot Y ou have to keep in \nmind that it is part of the process sometimes youre going to do boring tasks But of course keep the \nfun tasks as well  otherwise if you keep doing only boring tasks you might give up\nI always innovate If you are creating content or learning technologies and you end up learning or \nusing the same technology for many years youre going to get bored Always find new ways to learn \nand that should upgrade your career\nSummary\nIn this chapter we have covered how you can always be learning Y ou now have the tools to identify \nwhat you need to learn and what you need to practice Y ou also have an understanding of how to \napply justintime learning to accelerate your learning journey By planning your priorities in advance \nand identifying what it is that you want to learn you will be able to keep a focus on the big picture \nof what it is you want to accomplish on your career path In order to stay on your path you know \nthat you must apply deliberate practice methods and focus on implementing important habits to set \nyourself on a path to be always learning Now that you have this mindset of always learning with a \ndedicated and precise focus we can move on to discussing some types of learning that you may want \nto consider as you continue on your technical career journey As we mentioned earlier there are both \nformal and informal learning methods and pathways Both have a critical role to play in shaping your \nskillset and career\nIn the next chapter we will cover the essential elements of formal learning and certifications Formal \nlearning means you are told what you need to learn and the goals for the learning will be clearly \nestablished by an instructor or identified in an online learning course or certification program Using \nthe tools you have learned about here will help you to select the best formal learning and certifications \nfor your career journey2\nChoose Y our Best Path for \nLearning Training and \nCertifications\nOne of the unique advantages of technical careers is the normalization of continuous learning Learning \nnew skills actually changes and shapes your brain in positive ways As we mentioned in the Preface  \nof this book employers of this era expect their employees to constantly reskill themselves This puts \ndevelopers at an advantage because ongoing learning training and certifications are the hallmarks \nof developers While we know this to be true there is always this tension between formal informal \nand selftaught learning processes In this context certifications appear as a crucial way to validate \nthose learnings This chapter will discuss how to merge and benefit from all the learning possibilities \nthat are available for developers Therefore weve included the following main topics in the agenda \nof this chapter\n Deriving maximum benefit from formal learning\n Expanding your opportunities through informal learning\n Learning how to learn  selflearning\n Acquiring and benefiting from certifications\n Combining several learning possibilities\nSo without waiting any longer lets dive right into it\nDeriving maximum benefit from formal learning\nWhile formal learning is not the only method to gain technical skills it can provide a valuable base of \nknowledge or addition to existing knowledge In order to derive the maximum benefit from formal \nlearning you must be conscious and consistent Sometimes formal learning is undertaken as a Choose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 22\nrequirement to move on to the next step whether that be a degree or a position When you approach \nlearning in this way it is easy to lose sight of why you are taking the time to learn the topic or skill \nThis is not what you want to do Here are a few things we suggest\n Approach every learning experience by first clarifying and understanding why you are investing \nyour time and money or someone elses money if your employer is paying the costs\n Next be clear about what you want your learning outcomes to be through this formal learning \nexperience and keep your mind focused on this outcome throughout the educational experience\n While it is often not a requirement to have formal computer science learning it is often an \nadvantage to have formal learning and training especially for hiring and promotions Y ou \nshould consider investing the time and financial resources to obtain formal learning experiences\nThere are formal learning options offered through traditional university institutions with formal \ncomputer science courses and degree programs corporate training programs and coding bootcamps \nA coding bootcamp is a concentrated course that teaches technical skills and provides realworld \ntraining in computer and information technology fields Coding bootcamps shorten the time and  \nexpense that would be involved with a 4year college degree They often focus on technical skills that \nare easy and fast to learn such as frontend web development Bootcamps can provide an entry point \ninto a technical career Through a coding bootcamp learners can acquire skills that businesses need \nwithout spending time and money on a computer science degree For example many bootcamps can \nbe completed in 12 weeks This can also be used as a stepping stone in your career to position you to \nlearn other technologies and languages\nTraditional degree programs provide an extensive foundational base for critical thinking and complex \nproblemsolving Often traditional 4year programs also include instruction on coding in languages \nsuch as Java or Python Arguably the most critical skill in software development is complex problem\nsolving Combined with the essential emotional intelligence skills this is a powerful combination to \npropel your career forward A boot campstyle training program is also a formal learning option \nThese programs are often structured and shortterm offering an alternative to a degree program \nwhich can be more economical and shorter in duration They are typically focused on teaching \nspecific skills such as frontend coding with the objective of acquiring the skills and assisting in job \nplacement following the completion of the training These types of programs are often preferred by \nindividuals who are looking to make a career shift or transition into software development technical \nroles from nontechnical roles\nWe know developers who pursued a formal 4year computer science degree at universities who \nare frustrated when they are not hired for junior or entrylevel development jobs There are other \ndevelopers who are hired right out of a 4year university computer science degree program What \nworks for some developers will not work for others Do keep in mind that formal learning is important \nbut it is not the only type of learning required for a software development career it is not necessarily \nalways required eitherExpanding your possibilities through informal learning\n 23\nThere are also ongoing formal training programs that can be used to supplement any kind of formal \nuniversity or bootcamp training programs These can be on specific technical skills or more theoretical \nconceptual topics such as agile methodologies project management technical leadership or similar\nIn my experience there are often employerprovided training budgets and allocations for employees \nI am often surprised to find that many developers do not take advantage of and use these employee \nbenefits When I have asked why people do not utilize their training allocations it is usually because \nthey are too busy with their daytoday job or coding project I urge you to dedicate the time on a \nregular basis to take the formal training that is budgeted for by your employer or budget the funds in \nyour own financial planning if you are selfemployed or your employer does not provide these benefits \nLearning new skills will expand your mind and give you perspective in your daytoday coding work \nEven when it seems you do not need the skills at this time there is always something new to learn One \nof the leadership courses that I took in my earlier career began with understanding the premise Y ou \ndont know what you dont know until you know In other words until you gain knowledge you can \nbecome complacent in your belief that you know all that you require at that moment Once you obtain \nand assimilate new skills you discover the value of the information that you did not know before\nAll of these formal training options have their advantages Again keep in mind why you are undertaking \nthe training as you make your decisions on what type of formal training you will acquire\nExpanding your possibilities through informal learning\nIn Heathers two  decades of experience working with some of the top developers around the world \napproximately half of the developers I have worked with have been selftaught  meaning that they have \nnot completed formal learning to acquire their development skills\nWhether you have acquired your skills through formal learning or not there is a significant role to \nplay in informal learning Y ou will expand your career possibilities through informal learning\nThere are many forms that informal learning can take While there are a myriad of online audio and\nor video options available there are also books or ebooks or audiobooks and the oftenoverlooked \ninformal learning option of pair programming There are also books published by Packt on pair \nprogramming Informal learning has the advantages of being affordable accessible and selfpaced \nY ou must still keep at the top of your mind the motivation for your learning being pragmatic in the \ncourses or materials you decide to undertake for your informal learning path Plan to dedicate an \nhour or more every day to digesting some of this informal learning Take breaks as you go preferably \nevery 20 to 25 minutes and remember to share and discuss what you are learning with your peers \nThis can be done electronically or in person but this important element will cement the learning in \nyour mind and help you to apply your learning in your career\nAnother informal learning opportunity is through code reviews Many developers think of a code \nreview as a negative aspect of software development because it is often difficult to hear feedback \non your work and it is timeconsuming to explain and potentially defend the technical decisions \nthat you have made in developing software However code reviews are a wonderful opportunity for Choose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 24\nlearning not only technical skills but also critical thinking and communication skills as you approach \nand explain how you are solving problems and listen to your peers to learn from them Listening to \nlearn and understand is vastly different than listening only to have your turn to speak Listening can \nbecome a valuable skill and differentiator for you in your career as you seek to learn and understand\nIn selecting topics for your informal learning look for skill gaps in the projects you are working on \nboth in your paid development role as well as in any volunteer projects you are working on or following \nThe number of topics and informal learning options can be overwhelming so allow yourself to be \nselective and guided by the need or perceived future need for skills on a particular topic There is \nalways something new to learn so make peace with it and accept the reality that you will never know \nit all And you dont need to know it all Y ou dont need to have all of the answers to be successful or \neven to be an expert in your field In Part 2  Get Involved Participate in the Community  of this book \nwe will share how you can get more engaged in the community to help you to tap into the emerging \ndemands of new technologies\nSelect the mode of informal learning most suited to your educational style Do you retain information \nbetter via auditory or written delivery Often there are similar materials available in multiple forms  \nwritten audio and video Utilize the method that is most effective for you Y ou may also complement \nthe learning by consuming it in multiple ways to reinforce the materials I often like to watch a video \nand then refer to written materials either a book or online materials and then find audio recordings \nthat I can listen to after I have absorbed the key concepts Identify the methods that suit your particular \nlearning style\nOnce you find a combination of modes of learning that works for you you can continue to consume \nlearning materials in that style whether it is articles blogs podcasts videos or books There may be \ncertain times of the day when a mode of learning is more effective for you For example I like to listen \nto podcasts in the morning while I am doing my stretching exercises and I prefer to read articles or \nnewsletters later in the day Find experts with opinions that you respect and admire and follow them \non social media to be informed when they release new information Designate times during the day \nthat you can dedicate to learning There is a limitless amount of knowledge to consume so be sure \nto set limits on the time you spend learning versus the time you spend coding and working for your \nemployer or company Learning is important and should be an integral part of your career map\nOne of the best informal learning methods is pair programming This mode of learning allows you \nto learn in real time in a handson way from one of your peers Y ou can help each other learn from \neach other and share your learnings This can happen simultaneously and can also enable you to \nimprove your communication collaboration and emotional intelligence skills along the way If you \nare not currently engaged in pair programming look  for ways to incorporate this style of learning \ninto your work Y ou will reap the rewards both individually and collectively It will also complement \nyour other informal learning methodsSelflearning  be independent by learning how to learn\n 25\nSelflearning  be independent by learning how to learn\nWhile it is important to share your knowledge it is just as important to be independent in your \nlearning Part of the excitement in a technical development role is that technologies evolve and change \nconstantly In order to succeed then you must learn how to learn Y ou need to learn how to adapt \nto the expectation that you will need to acquire new skills and those are most often expected to be \nacquired by employees independently in their own time\nOnce you have identified the way you prefer to learn selflearning or learning how to learn becomes \nsecond nature It is an intrinsic part of the way you perform in your development role Y ou incorporate \nlearning new skills into your everyday routine and habits Making learning a habit takes time practice \nand commitment When you establish the idea that selflearning will be part of your routine identify \nthe way you learn best and commit to dedicating time for learning in your daily or weekly schedule \nit will become a habit Y ou will not need to be told what skills you should acquire you will identify \nthem and seek out ways to learn those new skills and technologies in a way that works best for you \nThis is an ongoing process As you learn remember to share what you are learning with others\nMake selflearning your superpower Become known for consistently and selectively identifying the \nskills that are required for your role This will not only benefit you in growing your skillset but will \nalso set you apart and differentiate you in your organization and career\nI know several developers who are known in the community for evaluating new tools and technologies \nThey are often sought out for new opportunities either to speak at conferences or to work on new \nprojects They have built their reputations and careers on learning how to learn\nTips to build your reputation and career include the following\n When you decide to learn a new skill share your experience as you go on social media and \nwith your peers\n Offer to present on topics alongside speakers colleagues or mentors you admire This is a \nfantastic opportunity to learn something new from someone with experiences you seek to add \nto your repertoire Heather interjects  I know of a developer working in Central America who \nhas utilized this method to advance their career   By selecting a topic you think is advantageous \nto learn you can then seek out experts who are familiar with this topic Y ou can learn from \nthem and discuss their experiences with them Y ou can also do some independent studying and \nlearning on your own and then bring your questions and areas of interest back to the expert \nfor further exploration This will deepen your learning and also strengthen the relationship \nwith the expert in your shared interest Y ou can look for opportunities to present together on \nthis topic It is an interesting experience to hear about a topic from the perspective of a long\ntime expert and pair this with the insights of someone newer to the skill It is very interesting \nto hear the viewpoints of a new learner with fresh eyes on the subject Look to provide your \nsocial media followers with a regular cadence of updates to your learning of the skill Be willing \nto share when you are making progress when you are stuck at a certain point or even when \nyou are lost or falling behind Y ou will be surprised at the camaraderie that follows when you \nare willing to be vulnerable to show your successes as well as your strugglesChoose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 26\n Create a presentation on your experience of learning a new skill and share your unique \nperspectives at conferences summits user group meetings or employer meetings\n Share the benefits you have realized by learning a new skill on social media and with your peers\n Offer to be a resource to people who want to learn more about this skill\nAcquiring and benefiting from certifications\nCertifications can communicate and verify your expertise with certain technologies They can \ndifferentiate you from others with similar credentials and experience and they can instill confidence \nin your skills and knowledge The benefits of certification will vary depending on your role location \nand experience level There are no disadvantages to certifications but their value will vary depending \non these factors\nFor example if you are an entrylevel junior developer a certification can help to supplement formal \nand informal learning Y ou may not yet have work experience to prove your expertise and skills but \ncertifications can be a way to supplement your education and verify your knowledge\nThe value of certifications will also vary depending on the reputation of the certifying institution \nThe more wellknown a certifying institution is and the higher its influence the more value will be \nconveyed with the certification For instance in the world of Java technology certifications the Oracle \nUniversity training and subsequent certification program is wellknown and highly regarded with \nthe expectation being that Java certification comes from Oracle University since Oracle is the steward \nof Java technology There are also certifications from other vendors or even some vendorneutral \ncertifications but for Java certifications Oracle University offers the gold standard\nThere are some developers in the Java community who are passionate and enthusiastic about certifications \nand advocate for developers to become certified on the latest versions as soon as the materials are \nreleased and available Indeed in some areas this is an essential criterion for some employers \nlooking for Java developer talent This is also a way for developers to differentiate themselves in the \nmarketplace I think of certain countries such as India for example where this can be particularly \nimportant Employers often seek a developer with a certification when they are hiring and even once \nemployed staying current on certifications and providing tips and suggestions to fellow developers \ncan become an area of expertise in your career There is a developer advocate in India who is known \nfor her advocacy around Java certifications and regularly speaks and writes blogs and articles around \nJava certifications In this way she has made certifications part of her personal brand and area of \nexpertise Members of the community will look to her as an expert in this field and go to her for \nadvice and questions on this topic\nSome Java certifications from Oracle University include the following\n Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 11 Programmer\n Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 ProgrammerAcquiring and benefiting from certifications\n 27\n Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 17 Programmer\n Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Programmer\n Oracle Certified Foundations Associate Java\n Java EE And Web Services Oracle Certified Professional Java EE 7 Application Developer\nThere will most likely be Java SE 21 certifications coming out in 2023 The certification path is typically \noffered for the  Java SE releases that are offered as LongTerm Support  LTS releases Java SE 11 was \nthe first Java SE LTS release followed by Java SE 11 and the next Java SE LTS release is planned to be \nJava SE 21 in September 2023\nThere are also certifications available from various cloud vendors and providers which you can use \nas a platform to deploy your applications such as from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure  OCI  In \naddition your location will be a factor in the value of certifications In certain areas of the world or \ncertain types of organizations there are requirements or expectations of certifications for beginner or \njunior programmers as well as more experienced or senior developers There is also the expectation \nthat certifications remain current and up to date If you have adopted the ability to learn how to learn \nthen this will be natural or second nature for you at this point\nMany developers in emerging economies often relay to me that certifications from a reputable source \nare essential in their communities due to the plethora of different certification options or authorities \nbeing offered in the region Often in more developed economies certifications are viewed as optional \nor nice to have In these economies experience is often more valued than certifications However \ncertifications are typically seen as either an added bonus or as a requirement depending on the area\nThere are also vendorneutral certifications available for certain technologies For example there are \nseveral vendorneutral and vendorspecific cybersecurity programs The vendorspecific programs \nwill give you an authority on a specific vendor platform The vendorneutral ones will focus on \ninteroperability and how the different offerings work or complement each other\nOnce you have obtained your certifications actively seek ways to apply the knowledge and techniques \nyou have learned in the courses required for your certification Be confident in asserting your knowledge \nbased on the certifications you have obtained from a source you can trust Be willing to communicate \nand share the learnings you have gained and establish yourself as a technical leader in this field Y ou \nnow have the credentials to back up your experiences and other learnings\nY ou should also add your certifications to your social mediaprofessional profiles This will help to \npromote your skills and drive awareness for you as a proactive learner\nSo far we have reviewed formal and informal learning options learning how to learn and obtaining \nappropriate certifications In the next section we will describe how to combine many of your learning \nopportunities to create a strong foundation for your technical careerChoose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 28\nCombining several learning possibilities\nAs you evolve  through your career and learning pathway you will need to combine all of the methods \nwe have discussed in this chapter to achieve career growth Y ou will undoubtedly have some formal \nlearning some informal learning and certifications and along the way you will acquire the ability to \nlearn Working as a software developer in the industry you will very quickly learn that the expectations \nfor continuous learning and improvement are real It can be overwhelming if you have not designed \na strategy to approach how you will learn Remember to evaluate how you learn and why you are \nlearning the skills you have identified Be purposeful in your approach to your learning Attempt to \ncombine some elements of all of these methodologies to learn\nContinuous learning and development can also be expensive Y our employer can often be a resource \nfor these expenses as part of your ongoing employee training and development budget All too often \nemployees do not utilize these budgets and they are unrealized Ensure that you are communicating \nwith your management about your ongoing training and development plans This will not only help \nwith expenses but also will guide your selection of tools and technologies ensure visibility of your \ncommitment to your development and ensure awareness of your career development plans and \nprogress We will talk more about taking responsibility for your career and your relationship with \nyour direct manager in the next chapter\nAsk yourself who you aspire to be Do you aspire to become a senior developer If so commit yourself \nto an ongoing process of learning and improvement Enjoy the process of continuous learning as a way \nto expand your knowledge base and skill set Many times developers will ask what type of training \nthey should select to advance their careers In reality it is a mix and a balance of activities that must \nbe selected strategically It is not a case of multiple choices and one answer and one size fits all Y ou \nmust evaluate the available learning options and let your career map guide you as you make your \nchoices Always keep the end goal and picture in mind as you decide where to invest not only your \nmoney but also your time Heather interjects here One of my favorite and guiding thoughts in my life \nhas to do with time You could say that I am obsessed with time Time is a precious resource  As Steve \nJobs has been quoted as saying the most precious resource we have is time  My favorite things in life \ndont cost any money Its really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time  So when you \nmake decisions on your learning path bear in mind not only the financial costs involved but also the \ncosts of your time Economists call this the opportunity cost Opportunity cost is the value of what \nyou lose when choosing between two or more options Y ou may lose money or you may lose time \nbut you make the choice based on whatever you decide will produce more value for you in the end \nno matter what you lose based on making and following through with that choice Actively seek out \nways to learn the skills and technologies you have identified Look for a base of formal learning and \nthen supplement it with informal learning and experiences to use those skills Identify and evaluate \nwhether there are ways to validate those skills through certifications Think about ways you can share \nyour learning processes to not only help others but also reinforce your own learning and process \nApplying your knowledge as you gain it is the best way to ensure that you continue on your path of \ncareer growthInterview\n 29\nAcquiring knowledge without applying and synthesizing the information provides little value Y ou \nmust actively find ways to apply your skills If you have been strategic in selecting what to  learn and \nif you have kept in mind your motivation or why you are learning along the way it will be a natural \nextension of your learning to apply it in your daily development work and projects\nInterview\nMala Gupta\nQ Can you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about who you are\nA I work as a developer advocate with JetBrains I have written a couple of books on Java mostly \non Java certifications One was on the new features of Java Im a Java Champion and I also lead two \ncommunities one is the Delhi Java User Group and the other one is Women Who Code Delhi Thanks \nfor the opportunity to let me talk about my journey\nQ Thank you so much Can you tell us a little bit about how you got started in your career and how \nyou got involved with technology\nA I did my undergraduate course in computer science The story of why I am a developer goes \nway back to when I was in class six That was when I started learning coding at my school and I \nimmediately knew that it was the career that I wanted to see myself in so I pursued it I did coding \nat school for a couple of years and then I did my undergraduate course in computer science Thats \nwhy I am a developer\nIn the late 1990s I started my first job I was working with Visual Basic in the beginning I liked that \nbut Java was taking off big time and I had to make a decision as to whether I wanted to go with Visual \nBasic or Java Java had the big promise of write once run everywhere  I liked that concept and so \nthats how I went toward Java\nFor my first job I was a Swing developer I made a desktop application in Swing and that still remains \none of the best projects that I think I worked on\nQ Cool Y ou said youre a Java Champion and a developer advocate Can you tell us how you got to \nyour current position and what you do\nA As I said I have been working with Java since I started my career Ive been doing development in \nJava for quite a long time Around 2010 I started thinking about writing books on Java\nWhen I graduated from college and started working as a Java developer I saw that there was a gap \nbetween what we were taught at university and what the industry demanded of us Soon after I joined \nmy second job I had to complete one of two Java certifications which was part of the requirements Choose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 30\nof the job One certification was SunCertified Java Developer and the other one was SunCertified \nWeb Component Developer which was on serverside Java\nI completed two certifications and that really helped me learn Java inside out That was one thing \nthat really stayed with me I got to know all the basics I could clear all the interviews after completing \nthose certifications and it also gave me a lot of insight into how Java works I was able to write more \nadvanced code\nIn 201112 I started thinking about writing books so that I could help either new developers or \nstudents from college to bridge that gap and gain Java certifications The certifications involve a lot of \nexam topics that you need to know about I used a lot of fun features in my book so that it was easy \nfor readers and thats how I got into writing\nI wrote a couple of books on Java and I also started speaking at colleges and conferences I also started \ncontributing to my community I became a contributor to the Delhi Java User Group and then one \nof the leaders and then I joined Women Who Code Thats how I progressed\nI met Venkat Subramaniam who will probably write a book and he nominated me to be a Java \nChampion I was already doing a lot of things that a developer advocate does and then I noticed a \ntweet by Trisha where she mentioned that they were looking for a Java developer advocate to join \ntheir team I reached out to her and thats how I got into the position that Im working in now\nQ Thats cool What is a developer advocate\nA Thats an interesting question All the developer advocates at JetBrains would give you a different \nanswer and that would apply to all developer advocates in different organizations\nI work as a Java developer advocate for JetBrains which essentially means that I help developers know \nand understand Java better so that they are able to use Java better in their daytoday jobs I try to \nmake that simpler for the Java developers because thats where my expertise is I try to make things \nsimple for them\nI do a lot of things I write blog posts create video content and speak at a lot of conferences and \ncolleges I have even organized a couple of online conferences with JetBrains as well as doing a lot \nof other things\nI work with the Java team at JetBrains A lot of input goes into figuring out how developers can use \nthe IDE in the best possible manner so that they can get the most from the language by putting in \nminimal effort Thats another area where I contribute\nQ Going back to the certifications has certification had an impact on your career How does that \nhelp you today to help other developers\nA Thats an excellent questionInterview\n 31\nIm still reaping the benefits of certification As I mentioned a certification has a set of topics that you \nmust know inside out to clear the exam And so when I talk about certifications Im not talking about \nthe piece of paper that I get at the end of the exam Im talking about the process Im talking about \nthe journey of people studying for the certification They have to know the basics which gives them \nall the knowledge that they need to get over the baseline and have a very strong foundation Then \nthey can talk about going on to advanced concepts such as architecting a solution\nFor me the biggest benefit has been having a very strong foundation I talk to some developers who \nhave 20 years of experience but they dont know a lot of the basics covered in the certifications I \ncovered my basics 20 years ago Every developer should know the basics What if people dont know \nthe basics and they start working on critical projects Then the casualties would be the project itself \ntheir colleagues time or the company The basics learned from certifications still help me a lot even \nnow in my day job\nQ As a developer advocate you help other developers to grow and to learn Java Do you recommend \nany certifications for other people What should developers do in terms of certifications\nA Certifications really help young developers when theyre starting their careers because as I \nmentioned they can build a very strong foundation if they do a certification A certification covers \nall the basics methods classes interfaces collection classes arrays IO streams lambdas and a lot \nof other things It really helps people to know all of that\nQ Today do you use certifications to help other developers Do you recommend that people \ndo certifications\nA Y es I do but not a lot I am still reaping the benefits of certifications as I mentioned\nThe process that I followed when I was studying for my certification was this I downloaded the \nsource code of the JDK and I opened the ZIP file I was using a text editor back then to prepare for \nthe certifications\nThe first time I saw the source code of the String  class I was blown away  Oh my God this is Java \ncode  Still today I make it a habit to look at the source code of the API that Im using or any other \nlibrary that I download That is just one of the things that helped me as a developer back then and \nIm still using it now\nI give this example to a lot of developers that I talk with Its about having your foundation A lot \nof people ask me  Why certification  This is what I tell them if there is another process that sees \nyou cover all these topics go for it but if not then this is something that is established and has been \nvalidated by a lot of people I have benefited from it I am living proof that yes it has benefits and \nIm still reaping them I definitely recommend it to people who are starting a Java career and I still \nuse the processes that I learned with it to help the developers I helpChoose Your Best Path for Learning Training and Certifications 32\nQ Awesome People think  If I have a certification I can get better jobs   Do you see that Do you see \ncompanies requiring certifications\nA Absolutely\nWhat are job seekers looking for They are looking for good jobs good projects or good companies \nto work with and they will have some rules or some conditions in place to assess whether they want \nto work for a company\nThe same applies the other way around as well Companies are looking for talent that has skills that \ncan be validated or certified If the candidate has a certification the company doesnt have to reinvent \nthe wheel and ask them all the questions that the certification exam has already asked them So its \na winwin for both of them\nCertification is recognized by industry the world over The exam objectives are updated by Oracle \nwith the latest version Anyone whos taking the exam will know the version theyre working with A \nlot of developers are still working on Java 8 so they are not aware of the module system or the new \nlanguage features that have come in A Java certification covers all of that Thats good for the projects \nthat these people work on and of course for the companies because they get people with verified \nand certified skills In the interview they can talk about advanced concepts with these people because \nthey know that the basics have been covered\nA good analogy that I always use is this would you like to go to a doctor who doesnt have a certificate \nor a degree but they say  I dont have a certificate but I have performed a lot of operations and surgeries  \nWould you like to go there I would never go to a surgeon or a doctor who doesnt have a degree\nA lot of people say to me that people go to universities to get a degree so why should they get additional \ncertifications Well we need to take a look at the longterm and the shortterm goals A degree at a \nuniversity is a longterm goal but when I talk about certification in a technology or a language Im \nlooking to certify my skills in that technology Thats a shortterm goal\nBen Wise\nAs we were writing this chapter Heather was in Singapore working with the developer community \nand hosting several events and workshops for students One of the most common questions from \ncomputer science students was how you can prevent yourself from being overwhelmed by all of the \ntechnologies tools and languages to learn If you use the techniques we discuss in this book you \ncan learn the right things at the right time and avoid burnout However we know that burnout does \nhappen in all industries but especially in technology and in times of uncertainty Around the same \ntime Heather met Ben Wise who is the owner and founder of STORYD storydriven and leadgen \nB2B ghostwriting for founders and executives He shared that he recently saw a therapist because he \nwas struggling with burnout and that burnout was winning\n I think about work when I dont want to\n I wake up in the night feeling anxious\n I feel sad and stressedSummary\n 33\nHe further shared that it was tough asking his general practitioner for help and telling the therapist \nhis symptoms He decided to share this information on LinkedIn where his team members vendors \nand clients could also benefit even though it triggered fears of being judged perhaps positioning \nhim not as an authority figure  but as just another vulnerable and fallible human who does not have \nall the answers\nBut he decided that having worked with founders and executives to develop personal brands that \nhelp grow their businesses on LinkedIn he knows that everyone struggles with this at one point or \nanother and he wanted to normalize the conversation about mental health So he agreed to share \nwhat the therapist

The areas we will \ncover include taking responsibility for your career finding support for what you need holding crucial \nconversations developing good negotiation skills and handling feedback including criticism and lack \nof support There are many people that can help you grow in your career  parents bosses leaders \nfriends and significant others  but the key word here is help  They can be awesome assets and \nsupporters but they cant advance your  career for you This chapter will show how you can hold the \ncrucial conversations you need to grow while taking responsibility for your career\nThe agenda of this chapter involves the following main topics\n Taking responsibility for your career\n Finding support for what you need\n Holding crucial conversations\n Developing good negotiation skills\n Feedback  dealing with criticism and lack of support\nTaking responsibility for your career\nY our career is YOUR career The  only person that is fully responsible for everything that happens for \nyour growth and for your opportunities is you\nThat does not mean that you shouldnt request or accept help It just means that you should see other \npeople that are willing to help as helpers They can help you advance and they can make your path easier \nor faster But the reality is no matter whether you receive help or not its always your responsibilityOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 36\nWhat does it mean to take responsibility\nThe most basic thing  about taking responsibility is to stop blaming others since the most common \nway to avoid responsibility is to blame others for difficulties or challenges in life\nMy company doesnt give me opportunities\nMy boss doesnt send me to events\nMy colleagues dont help me\nOr even my significant other is not supporting me\nThe economy The inflation The government\nAll of these are ways to avoid responsibility and blame other people for our problems\nThat is not to say that there are no difficulties Of course our life is full of challenges and difficulties \nand often our friends family and even company can be a hindrance or an obstacle to our growth \nAnd yes inflation the government and other regulations are out of our control\nBut every time we consider that it is their fault and not our responsibility we end up not being able \nto do anything If it is them there is nothing we can do We cant change our families We cant force \nour boss to do something We cant singlehandedly change our companys policies or change the \ngovernment or the economy for that matter\nThere are of course some things that are outside of our control There are problems and issues that \nwe alone cannot solve If you are facing challenges in your career  and we all do at some point in our \ncareer journey  the first thing to do is to identify the problem Next you should determine whether \nit is within your power or control to change or influence the problem Stop and evaluate your role in \nthis and whether you can solve the problem through your own actions There will be some problems \nthat we cannot control In that case we must decide how we will react and respond such as in an \neconomic recession There are other problems that we can directly or indirectly influence or respond \nto such as our current job responsibilities\nWhen we blame others we are at their mercy\nWhen we consider that it is their responsibility and for one reason or another they dont do what we \nwant them to do we get stuck Theres nothing that we can do We dont have any action plan going \nforward All we can do is stay stuck and sulk\nWe stop being protagonists of our life\nThats why it is so important to recognize that the only person able to take action is you\nThe only person responsible and to blame for any failures or any problems is also you\nThis may sound very  despairing it may sound like a lot of weight to carry on your shoulders In \nreality its very liberatingWhat does it mean to take responsibility\n 37\nNow that you know that it is your fault and that you are the only one responsible for the direction of your \nlife then you can take some action and figure out what is missing and why you are not getting results\nThat is very liberating indeed It liberates you to take action instead of sulking Believing others \nare to blame is a limiting belief It limits what you can do your actions and your opportunities \nUnderstanding that we are responsible is a liberating truth It allows you to search for possibilities to \nbe creative and imagine alternatives and to look for and find new paths around the obstacles Every \ntime you see yourself blaming someone or avoiding responsibility realize that this is a limiting belief \nEvery belief even if it may be true will only be true if you let it be\nIf youre open to giving it another shot and turning that limiting belief into a liberating truth you have \nthe opportunity to discover something equally valid that can propel you forward\nFor example lets imagine the case where your company does not support your advancement Y ou \ncould say that it is true that your company does not have a policy that allows you to train or go to \nevents or training I cannot advance because my company does not support my training This is true \nbut it is a limiting belief\nY ou can turn that into a liberating truth For example you could say it is true that you can use the \ntime between meetings to learn something new I can find 15 minutes a day to experiment with some \nnew technology within my job\nThat is now a liberating truth It is true And it is something YOU can take action to do\nIf you can do that 15 minutes a day during your work hours you will start to advance in your job\nY ou might be thinking that 15 minutes is just too little  I need more time\nThat could be true but the reality is youre no longer stuck on the previous limiting belief although \nyou may need to work to create a liberating truth around the new challenge\nI cannot advance  because 15 minutes a day is not enough time\nThis is a limiting belief\nI can start with 15 minutes a day and if Im consistent and on some days I have a bit more time the \nconsistency will make a difference Consistency is better in the long run\nThats a liberating truth I can now take action\nThat will allow you to continue to take action and to continue to move forward\nY ou have the responsibility to take these actions Lets say as an example you have a manager that does \nnot seem invested in your career In this case remember that you have the responsibility to develop \na relationship with your manager and your managers manager Take action to meet with them and \nkeep the conversation moving in the direction that you want it to go Ask the questions to determine \nwhat is keeping them up at night Determine how you can be part of the solution and communicate \nhow you can be part of the solutionOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 38\nWhen we talk about taking responsibility for our careers its simply taking responsibility for finding \nthe right path and finding something that you can actually do that will move your career forward \nevery day every week and every month\nFinding support for what you need\nKeeping our responsibility in mind the reality is that we do not advance alone Having help and \nsupport will allow you to advance faster Thats why its very important to  find the support you need\nFinding support is in most cases not finding someone that will do things for you but the right people \nthat can guide and direct you to the best solution which you will work on implementing yourself\nThere are many ways to look for help Y ou can reach out to friends and colleagues ask for help from \nfamily get support from your boss and even request official support from your company\nThose are the normal ways\nToday the internet is a great  place to find help even from people you dont know Y ou can follow \nexperts Y ou can read books subscribe to blogs and watch Y ouTube videos\n Read books\n Elearning\n Attend conferences\n Subscribe to blogs\n Watch Y ouTube videos\nWhen you follow people that you trust and who can help you overcome your issues even if they dont \nknow you they can still be very very helpful\nThe one problem you have to look out for when getting help from people that you dont know and that \nyou dont have direct contact with is the lack of accountability It makes it harder for you to take action\nWhen you receive help from someone close to you such as friends and family colleagues or your \nboss they are able to motivate you and you have a level of accountability with them If you dont take \naction they will notice and they will call you out on it Y ou have a big motivation to take action Y ou \ncant ask for help from your boss or your spouse and then not act on their advice for too long\nBut thats not going to happen with Y ouTube videos and blogs Either YOU take action or no one \nknows People you read or watch cant push you forward without contact with you The internet has \nat the same time made it easier to get help from people but also less efficient Make sure you take \nthis into account when using those means to get supportFinding support for what you need\n 39\nScott Wierschem\nScott Wierschem is a wellknown developer He attributes some of his success to his networking at \nconferences and his blogs\nScott is a developer with  a passion for legacy code and cleaning up the code in older projects He found \nhis passion in his daytoday work but he did not have many opportunities to expand his network in \nhis role working with longterm clients on their legacy code projects Once he had the opportunity to \nexpand his network he applied his skills to create an additional business opportunity for himself He \nmet Java luminaries in his social network and became an influencer and blogger His network inspired \nhim to create an impact and share his knowledge beyond what he was able to share in his daytoday \nprojects Very early in his career he chose a poor mentor  but was so naive he didnt realize it He \nshares the following story from that time\nMy mentor was very cynical and taught me not to trust anyone and never stand out Shortly after we \nhad that conversation I was laid off so that seemed to confirm his advice That crippled my career for \ndecades until I met Bruno Souza I was miserable and looking for a different career He encouraged me \nand helped me to understand that I knew a lot and could help others by standing out and sharing my \nknowledge I gave talks at Java User Groups and at conferences such as JavaOne I created a business \nplan inspired by a talk from Legacy Code Rocks and it has revolutionized my career  and my life I now \ndeliver weekly training sessions write articles and teach lessons This gave me flexibility and freedom \nto practice my job create training lessons and publish an ebook in my free time I just wish I had met \nhim decades earlier\nBarry Burd\nBarry attributes some of his early career success to his ability to network to form new connections \nHe is a professor at Drew University an author and a trainerconsultant In the earlier days of his \ncareer he was looking online and found a local user group meeting that interested him He attended \nthe New Y ork Java SiG and started to grow his social network Barry found that it can feel lonely to \nthink about networking in a new group but if you are in the right place you are growing your network \norganically As a professor talking with developers about their projects and keeping up with technical \ndiscussions provides a social network but also a strong sense of maturity Conversations can give \nyou an understanding of the context of how technology is used to solve current problems and an \nhonest view and perspective Interactions with your social network can provide outcomes you may \nnot expect but you learn from your  connections and enjoy the process and the relationships along \nthe way As Barry says\nA user group is an excellent place for learning new things but when I was just starting out I wanted to \nfind consulting work by joining two user groups At almost every meeting I attended no one mentioned \nthe possibility of my working for them I could have been discouraged But at two of the sessions one in \neach of the two groups people asked me about conducting training for their companies Both leads ended \nup being very profitable for me I guess the moral of this story is this when your networking opportunities \ndont seem to be paying off dont be discouraged Theyre paying off whether you realize it or notOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 40\nAsking for help\nWhen you ask for help you are asking the other person to take time from what they want to do to \nhelp you do what you want to do It is reasonable that people prefer to do what they want instead of \nwhat you want\nSo when you ask for help try to help the other person to help you\nThat may sound strange because you are the one trying to get help How can you possibly help the \nother person\nMake sure that the other person has a number of reasons to help you and the least amount of resistance\nWhen you ask someone for help make clear that you just need them for a few minutes They wont \nneed to spend a long time or make a big effort to help you Ask for five minutes from them so they \ncan point the way or help you unblock\nAlso you may want to try a no oriented question People have less resistance to saying no than \nyes  Experiment with  Would it be a ridiculous idea if I asked you to help me with this problem  \nfor 5 minutes \nAnother important aspect when you ask for help is to research things yourself first\nThere are many places you can go to research Try looking at some examples on GitHub or in the \nissue tracker of a related project JIRA etc or try searching on Stack Overflow Reddit or Quora \nArtificial Intelligence has recently supercharged your research capabilities and you should also consider \nusing ChatGPT and other AI tools If you do your research and take time to educate yourself on the \nsubject not only will it be easier to ask for help you will also benefit more from the help you receive\nWhen you do decide to approach someone about your question and you say  I dont know how to do \nX can you help me   that does not give enough context even if they want to help you\nWhen you show the things you did try and how they failed or where you got stuck that not only will \nhelp set the context of the situation but will also make it more probable that people will help you and \nmake it easier for them to do so\nWhen you give the context people can see where you are how much effort you have been putting \ninto it and the  challenges you have already overcome All this context will make it easier to help you \nmove forward in the direction that you want\nOne situation that you will commonly need help with is when you need some kind of connection \nor introduction Such as when you want to connect with someone that could help you or that you \nwant to invite to an activity Or when you want to be recommended for a job position or need to hire \nsomeone Another example could be when you would like help promoting your content maybe a \nblog post or your new Y ouTube video\nAll those situations require the person you are asking for help to write a message or a note about you \nto send to someone else Y ou can make this a lot easier if you create the note or the email yourself and Asking for help\n 41\noffer it as a suggestion  If you have a few minutes could you introduce me to your friend soandso I d \nlike to invite them to give a talk at my company If it helps below you can see a little introduction text I \ndrafted to help you reach out to them Feel free to adapt it in any way you want \nThis is not a copy and paste job make sure the text you draft is written thinking about the person you \nasked for help and that they would be comfortable using it\nWhen you make the effort and make it easy for others to help you theres a much bigger chance that \nthey will want to help you\nAnother way to help people help you is to look for opportunities that turn the fact that they are helping \nyou into something that actually helps them move their careers forward\nFor example imagine youre trying to get help to become an open source developer A good strategy \nis getting help from existing open source developers Y ou may be looking for help in finding a suitable \nproject to join or you may want help with what you need to do and how to implement the steps\nThis is asking for help Y ou are asking them to take time from what they want to do to help you do \nwhat you want to do\nLets try to turn this around Y ou do some research and find that the person you want to ask for help \nis working on her  own open source project Instead of asking her to help you you could offer to help \nher with her projects Y ou could offer help with small things such as promoting the projects writing \na tutorial or improving the documentation\nWith this small but very thoughtful offer you make yourself helpful first Y ou are spending YOUR \ntime to help them advance THEIR project That helps the other person to want to help you because \nhelping you will actually help them advance their own goals\nY ou help people by thinking of them first Y ou may think that you are the person that needs help so \nyou cant help anyone But no one is so helpless that they cannot help and at the same time no one \nis so selfsufficient that they dont need any help\nTurn things around by thinking about how you can help others When you start putting them first \nyou make yourself useful and make yourself even just a little important for them and thats going \nto bring more help your way\nThis mentality of wanting to help will make you a giver someone that gives more than they receive \nResearch shows that givers are the people that have more opportunities in companies and the job \nmarket Position yourself as a giver It will help you achieve all your big goals\nOne important comment on asking for help maybe you try to get help by asking the person to do \nsomething for you Remember that people are usually not interested in doing things for us\nIts your responsibility If you want anything done you have to do it\nWhen looking for help focus on asking for guidance Ask for tips to get you unblocked and for ideas \nto speed things up This is a winwin situation Mindset changes are the most powerful for you and Optimize Your Support Network for Growth 42\nyour career because they change the way you do things At the same time they take less time from \nyour guide who will mostly show you the right way of doing things They may be able to point you \nto an idea technique person tool or technology that will help you get unstuck and advance\nWith that said you also  have to pay attention and take action The guidance and suggestions you \nreceive can be extremely valuable and can have a lasting impact on your career but only if you take \naction on them Nothings going to change your life if all you do is listen and forget about it\nHolding crucial conversations\nThe best help  someone can give you is to have a deep conversation with you about your current \nsituation and where you want to go If you have a chance to have a conversation like this not only \nshould you take it but make sure you make the best of it\nThe more you understand what the person is telling you what the tip is or how to apply it the better \nresults youre going to have So when asking for help make sure that you ask lots of questions\nMany times Ive had people approach me and ask how to do a specific thing and I tell them and can \nsee they understand what Im saying but they still dont see how to apply it or even dont believe it \nis possible\nUsually the reason is that they dont see the connection to their current situation\nI may linger for a bit to see if they will ask followup questions and most times there arent any So \nI ask questions instead to try to uncover the context and get clarity on the real situation Otherwise \nit is hard to connect the dots and help with clear specific steps\nBut most people that are willing to help you will not be that detailed and they may just answer your \nquestions To help them help you make sure to present where you really are Describe your situation \nso people can give you help on the right things\nHolding crucial conversations is all about asking questions from both sides\nAsking questions is sometimes scary It may feel like it will make us look dumb Or it may show that \nwe do not understand It can leave us vulnerable We are vulnerable Thats why were asking for help\nDont be afraid of asking questions Make sure you understand how to apply the suggestion to your \ncurrent situation If not ask\nDeveloping good negotiation skills\nFor your career  growth negotiation is one of those skills that are fundamental but largely neglected \nThis is probably because it is a skill not usually associated with technical jobs and only thought about \nwhen we are negotiating salariesDeveloping good negotiation skills\n 43\nBut negotiation is a skill that we use daily every time we have priorities and expectations that involve \nother people\nWe negotiate even during our free time  where we will eat on the weekends where we will spend \nour vacations the responsibilities we have at home how much time we can spend with friends \nand what we will do during that time When we are working we negotiate what feature needs to be \nimplemented who will implement it and how it will be implemented When we negotiate our career \ndevelopment we determine which jobs we will take what salaries we will be paid which projects \nwe will work on which responsibilities are ours which mentors we will have what bonus we will \nreceive which stock options we will take when it is time to move on to another role when to ask for \na promotion and so much more\nWe face many small and large negotiations every day We can recognize them and be good at that skill \nor we may ignore the skill and basically be trumped in most situations in life\nAlexandra Carter is a worldrenowned negotiator for the United Nations and wrote the book Ask For \nMore  In her book Alexandra talks about the 10 Questions to Negotiate Anything  The first five questions \nare the conversations that you have with yourself These questions will help you understand what you \nwant how to ask for it and help you understand what your approach should be to get what you want\nWe have summarized the questions here\n Question 1 Whats the problem I want to solve  Sometimes you have to spend time to save \ntime Think about what it is you really want at the end of the discussion\n Question 2 What do I need  Think clearly about what you need and do not confuse this \nwith your demands Y ou can visualize what you find intolerable and flip the situation around \nAlso be wary of allowing what others think you need to answer this question\n Question 3 What do I feel  Once you determine what you need you need to face your \nfeelings Remember never to fear negotiation or to negotiate out of fear\n Question 4 How have I handled this successfully In the past  Y our past negotiation successes \nwill often provide clues as to how you can be successful in future negotiations Think about \nthings that have gone well for you in the past\n Question 5 Whats the first step  After you finish asking yourself the questions you are  ready \nto ask the questions see the information box with five tips for asking questions\n Question 6 Tell me  In this step you ask the other party to share their perspectives on the \nproblem scenario and solution\n Question 7 What do you need  Y ou should never assume you know what the other party needs \nMake sure you summarize and repeat back to them what they say and ask followup questions\n Question 8 What are your concerns  Y ou want to be able to understand their perspective \nand what they may be thinking about as they negotiate with youOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 44\n Question 9 How have you handled this successfully in the past Involve the other party \nin a conversation on how they have handled this situation before to help you work together to \ncome up with a solution\n Question 10 Whats the first step  This question helps to establish you as partners and to \ntake action together Be empathetic to their needs and concerns to establish trust\nFive tips for asking questions of the other party\n Land the plane  also known as ask the question\n Enjoy any silence\n Ask followup questions\n Summarize and ask for feedback\n Listen to what has not been said\nAnother useful book on negotiation strategy is by Christopher Voss a former FBI negotiator He \nauthored the book Never Split the Difference  which lists the tools he uses to improve negotiation \nHere are six tips from the book\n One mindset  To be a good negotiator you need to have the mindset of a negotiator\nNegotiation is not a confrontation but it is a learning opportunity When you approach a \nnegotiation you should not be trying to win or to best the other person Negotiation should \nbe a situation where you try to achieve a result that is beneficial for everyone Thats what we \ncall a winwinwin situation\nApproach negotiation as a learning opportunity Y ou are learning what the other person wants \nand also what is important for you Y oure learning about the challenges in making those things \nhappen and the consequences of them happening or not happening\n Two listen  The most important skill of a negotiator is listening Negotiation is all about \nlistening understanding the other side But not just listening  active listening asking questions\nMost people listen just to be able to answer or just to be able to argue back This is the wrong \nway of listening Listen to understand and clarify what the other side wants what they think and \nwhat they believe Once you understand its much easier for you to look for a winwin situation\n Three time it right  Part of negotiation is finding the best time Try to time your negotiation \nto happen in the best moment possible\nIf you can time your salary negotiation at a moment when your company can see your value \nand is looking forward to working more with you youre going to have better success than if \nyou time it for when you are being unproductive or youre not happy with your work\nOf course if you  delay the negotiation and dont plan your timing other conditions may force \nyou to negotiate at the worst time for you or at the best time for the other partDeveloping good negotiation skills\n 45\nSalary negotiation for example is best done as a continuous improvement process for your \ncareer at your company Its not a process where you only engage when you join and you are \nvery happy and when you want to leave because youre unhappy\n Four framing  The fourth idea around the negotiation is framing or context When you set \nthe frame and the context you help other people see what you see\nA good way to create a frame is to complete the statements  Have you ever  and  Do you know \nwhen   For example I could say  The best moment to start to negotiate a salary increase is when \nyou just got a salary increase   This may sound preposterous unclear and even untrue Or I \ncould say  Have you ever noticed that people that have a continuous conversation with their boss \nabout their goals and results are more aligned with their bosses expectations and can better show \ntheir value to the company Thats why the best moment to start negotiating salary increases is \nwhen you just got a salary increase it should be a continuous process\nIsnt this much more impactful and believable Can you see that when we add context you \nhelp people see what you see\nThats what framing is Do this for your negotiations and they will give you much better results\n Five give and get  Be generous and have gratitude in your negotiations and you will have \nmuch better results\nRemember negotiation can be a  winwin discussion It is not about destroying your opponent \nand getting all the results you want That is just tyranny Negotiation is about finding a place \nwhere we all win Y ou get a better salary Y our family lives better and is more secure Y our \nboss gets a happy employee that wants the best for the company and is a partner in its success \nWin Win Win\nWhen you get something in a negotiation give something When you are generous while \nnegotiating you help all parties to be happy with the results\nAnd the same thing is true for the other side When you give something expect to get something \nY ou should be generous not naive\n Six walk away  The sixth and last negotiation principle is about being able and willing to \nwalk away Its important to avoid emotional decisions Make sure that when you walk into \nthe negotiation you have the facts you have the reasoning and you have clarity about what \nyou want Make your best effort to understand what others want Get the facts from their \nside too That will help you avoid negotiating only based on your emotions When you avoid \nemotional decisions its easier to walk away if needed If you get to a point in the negotiation \nwhere things are not converging to a winwin resolution be ready to just say  Thank you but \nno thank you   Gracefully walk away\nThats going to give you the power to really negotiate If you cant walk away from a negotiation \nthen youre in no position to negotiateOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 46\nFor example if you tell your boss that if they dont increase your salary youre going to leave \nbut you dont have another company to move to or you dont have enough visibility in the \nmarket to easily get an offer you are negotiating from a weak position Setting aside that putting \npeople against the wall is a terrible way to negotiate it never yields longterm results if they \ndont give you a better salary youre stuck Not being able to walk away is going to undermine \nyour position and even make future negotiations harder \nNegotiation is an important and valuable skill Dont only think about it when you need it because \nthat is too late Start now Practice asking questions Listen Negotiate small things in life Get good \nat negotiating small things and you will be much better off when big things show up\nThe most important things to remember about negotiation are that it does not have to be a conflict or \nconfrontational and that everything is negotiable Use the techniques we described to partner together \nto come up with a solution that not only works for you and your career but for the other parties as \nwell whether in your career or in life\nFeedback  dealing with criticism\nWhen we talk about negotiation we have to talk about feedback\nNot because feedback is a type of negotiation but because feedback is an important part of working with \nother people and trying to achieve results together To work together we need to correct each other\nAlso feedback is very important for selfimprovement Its incredibly hard for us to judge ourselves \non the things we do since many things we do are not clear and objective Receiving feedback from \nother people such as our peers and our bosses is extremely important for us to understand whether \nwere on the right track\nBut feedback also hurts Not positive feedback of course That is always fun to receive Negative \nfeedback shows that we have been wrong or mistaken and that hurts but negative feedback is crucial\nIf feedback is important then negative feedback is even more important It may be nice and fun to \nknow that we are right But it can be lifesaving to know when we are wrong\nOnly when we know we are wrong can we correct it We can fix it We can improve\nThats why for example in software development we want a fast feedback loop When we build and \ntest our code we want the system to tell us that we are wrong very fast so that we can correct it before \nmistakes can spread to the rest of the system\nCan we do the same with our abilities and our daily actions Thats where feedback comes in handy\nSo if we agree that this is important and it will help us improve why dont we like feedback negative \nfeedback of course It hurts\nThe most likely reason why we dont like feedback is because it shows our ignorance and it shows \nwhere we failed It also shows our vulnerability Being vulnerable in your job or in your career is riskyFeedback  dealing with criticism\n 47\nMaybe you imagine  that if your boss sees that you are wrong you might not get a promotion If your \ncolleagues see that you failed you might not get respect\nFeedback also impacts our views of hierarchy When someone gives us negative feedback we might \nfeel lower than they are This is not something conscious but it is something that impacts our lives\nY es negative feedback can really hurt\nHowever since feedback is very important here is a factbased approach that incorporates some \nsuggestions on how to receive negative feedback in a way that would make it constructive no matter \nthe intention of the person giving the feedback\nStep 1 Is the feedback a fact\nNot all feedback we receive is factbased A lot of it is actually an impression a feeling or a persons \nopinion Theres nothing wrong with someones opinion but someones opinion may be wrong or may \nbe just something that you dont agree with\nSo start by evaluating the feedback and whether it is a fact or not\nIf it is an impression or opinion you can either safely discard it or accept it as feedback to consider \nlater based on the intentions and the source of the feedback Everyone is entitled to their own opinions \nY ou are entitled to your own opinion too\nFor example if someone says  I dont like this book I think it is badly written   thats an opinion\nY ou may agree or disagree with it but it is just an opinion\nNow imagine someone says  I dont like this book it is full of English mistakes and has factual errors \nAlthough there is an opinion there  I dont like this book  there are things that are not merely an  \nopinion anymore There are facts Discard the opinion and take the parts that are factual to the next step\nStep 2 Are the facts true\nJust because someone stated facts it doesnt follow that theyre necessarily true\nLooking at the book example we can check and test whether it is true or not that the book is full of \nEnglish mistakes\nIf the facts are false its not necessarily the persons fault Maybe they missed something or maybe they \ndid not understand what was going on Maybe they saw only parts of it But if the feedback mentions \nfacts and the facts are false disregard that part of the feedback That should not affect you\nEven very bad and hurtful comments and feedback if they are false should not affect you\nBut maybe the facts are true Maybe the book is full of English mistakes If so keep going to step 3Optimize Your Support Network for Growth 48\nStep 3 Is there anything you want to or can do about it\nAssuming the facts are true then you can evaluate whether there is anything you want to or can do \nabout it\nIf the book is full of English mistakes you may want to correct them And if you do the feedback was \nvery useful and had a good result\nNow maybe the book is not focused on being sold Maybe it was just an experiment to test whether \nan artificial intelligence transcription system would work well And the fact that it is full of mistakes \ndoes not matter much or at all\nSo maybe you will decide to not do anything about it When you use those three steps to evaluate \nfeedback you take a lot of the emotion out of it If the feedback is a fact and it is true and you want \nto fix it you can just go and fix it and the feedback was valuable Y ou will even be very thankful to \nthe person that mentioned it\nBut if the feedback is not factual then whoever gave it is entitled to their own opinion Theres nothing \nyou can do about opinions If the feedback is a fact but its not true then the person probably just \nmade a mistake And if the feedback is a fact its true but you did it that way because you wanted to \nand you wouldnt or maybe couldnt do any differently then its all according to the plan and you \nwill just deal with the consequences of the mistakes\nWhen said like this it sounds like it is easy to receive negative feedback It is not\nAs we mentioned before negative feedback is very hard to receive Hopefully this process will help \nyou take a little bit of the emotion out of receiving feedback and will help you use unavoidable negative \nfeedback to improve your career\nThe interesting thing  about this process is that even when negative feedback is given specifically to \nhurt you to be mean and attack you you can still use it to improve\nBasically when you hear feedback pay close attention and separate what is a fact from opinions What \nare the facts What are the opinions\nIf it is mean hurtful feedback but it does mention something true then you can take some action fix \nthings and improve There is no better response to mean evil feedback made to put you down than \nusing it to grow even more Y ou will use their negativeintentioned feedback to improve yourself\nThis all ties back to taking responsibility for your career Listening and acting on the feedback you \nreceive is a very mature and responsible thing to do Not only will you improve yourself but you will \nshow seniority and trust to everyone around you\nLastly be thankful for the person that gave the feedback even if the feedback was hurtful or negative \nbecause it might not have been their intention but it will help you to grow and be a lot better in the futureInterviews\n 49\nInterviews\nNikita Koselev\nWhile writing this book we spoke with Nikita Koselev about his experiences living and working \nas a developer just outside of London Nikita shared with us the ways in which his community has \nsupported him In this interview transcription Nikita introduces himself and provides some context \nfor his current situation before delving into the topic of building a community of his own as a support \nnetwork and the impact it has had on his life\nQ What led you to get into computer science or to become a developer\nA Oh well two things One  is that Im into computers and anything to do with them and finance \nAnd the second thing is food because Im from an extremely poor background From the age of 15 \nmy family could not afford to buy yogurts So they were buying chocolates 3 months past due and \nstuff like that And my dream was I will become a software developer and then I will eat only yogurts \nbecause thats the selection of food that developers eat Well it lasted for a month then I had to switch \nI like them again now but there was a long pause in eating yogurts and other niceties My motivation \nto become a software developer was income\nQ How did you train Did you teach yourself or attend school\nA I did quite badly in my exams at school I didnt know Im autistic but I found a course that as \nI thought at the time was the closest thing to computer science  power electronics or something \n and it was a huge mistake because it was the one that was the furthest from computer science So \nbasically I was just going to all the computer science courses I could and I tried to pick up minimal \nfor the energetics so they didnt throw me out too fast Then I transitioned to another course and \nthen to another course Meanwhile I was helping people who got good grades in IT and then I was \nthere They tried to throw me out of university three times  two times by mistake Like oh we just \nforgot your paper in the desk drawer  stuff like that whatever But one time it was for a valid reason \nbecause I switched payment format so I needed to wait\nQ How has the community helped you and how did you discover that the community would support you\nA The community has helped me find purpose in life I realized that I could work with people and \ncreate something good which helped me form a stronger connection with my team With medication \nand help I began to help the community at work and raise the flag high I met some amazing people \nin the community such as Bruno Souza who runs the biggest Java group in the world and he helped \nme understand that our main values come from sharing It was at Devoxx UK in London where I \nmet Benjamin Mascall and Sal Kimmich that I learned how to become a good developer through \nOpenJDK contributionsOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 50\nQ Can you tell us more about Sal Kimmich and his idea of guiding people to make their first open \nsource commit\nA Sal Kimmich is a person who supports and guides individuals until they make their first open source \ncommit Once they have accomplished that he lets them go because the hardest part is done I thought \nthat this was a great idea and I decided to create a meetup called Together with Open Source to \nhelp people who cannot go to universities such as MIT or Oxford but can still do very well in IT It is \nespecially helpful for people from underrepresented groups and those who face discrimination In IT we \nare judged by our work and our skin color or gender does not matter I wanted to mentor people who \ndo not know what they like and build a bridge for them to find something they are passionate about\nQ How do you help people who do not know what they like to find something they are passionate about\nA When people come to me and say they want to work in finance and live in London I start asking \nthem questions to determine whether they really love finance For example I ask whether they read \nthe Financial Times to their grandmother and whether they engage in financial dealings If they do \nnot I ask them what they do love If they say they teach other students molecular chemistry then I \ncan help them learn about finance but in 20 years they might be sitting somewhere in London in a \nsmall expensive onebedroom apartment disconnected from all their relatives I want to help people \nfind something they truly love and that gives them purpose\nQ How does your community involvement help you with your career\nA Being involved in the community helps me find purpose in life and it gives me a stronger connection \nwith my team I no longer have bystander or imposter syndrome and if something is wrong I raise \nthe flag I also help people find something they love which gives me a sense of accomplishment and \npurpose When I was struggling with depression the community helped me by providing support \nand finding ways to help me find purpose in life I realized that if I stand up and work with people I \ncan create something good and make a difference\nQ Can you tell us more about how you became a good developer through OpenJDK contributions\nA OpenJDK contributions helped me become a good developer because they provided me with an \nopportunity to contribute to the development of Java one of the most widely used programming \nlanguages in the world Contributing to OpenJDK allowed me to work with some of the smartest \npeople in the industry and learn from them I did not become a good developer by taking courses \ninstead I learned by contributing to OpenJDK which allowed me to gain practical experience and \ndevelop my skillsInterviews\n 51\nHelio Silva\nWe also had the pleasure of speaking with Helio Silva a distinguished technical value advisor for \nLatin America in the observability industry In this interview Helio introduces himself and discusses \nthe importance of building a supportive community and the impact it has had on his life and career\nQ How did you get  into this career\nA It was through a friend We worked together at another company Basically once he remembered \nhe had this opportunity he called me  Hey theres an opportunity here in the company Im working \nfor and I think it is a perfect fit for you Will you allow me to share your name with the hiring manager \nso the hiring manager can contact you Maybe you can talk and it could be good for you as well   This \nwas how it happened\nQ Do you get many jobs like this or was that the first time A job where people call you because they \nthink that you are the right person\nA After becoming senior I think most of  if not all  the jobs I got were through recommendations \nLet me do a fast count here The last six jobs I got were through recommendations\nQ Do you think that when you get a job through a recommendation it is easier in terms of going \nthrough the interviews and getting a good offer\nA Y es for sure When someone posts a position on the web you already see that people ask for a lot \nof different things Sometimes you dont exactly know what the person needs what the hiring manager \nneeds or what the company really needs Sometimes you can identify the technology very easily If \nwe are talking about a more junior position such as a simple Java web developer for example or a \nJava frontend developer you know that the most important thing is the person knowing Java the \nperson knowing web dev technologies  this type of thing So its easy But when you are looking for \nmore positions like my position that I used to say this is after senior its hard to understand what the \nposition is looking for or what the hiring manager is actually looking for When someone refers you \nto a position they will provide you with extra context For example they will say  Hey I am looking \nfor someone that knows Java but also someone that can manage customer expectations or someone \nthat has experience with this type of database but also has already led a team in a previous job   In this \nway you can be more prepared when you talk with the hiring manager for example because you \nknow exactly what the person is looking for and you can match what the person is looking for to \nyour experience So you will be more prepared for sure Also to add to that youll be more secure \nbecause you know what the person is looking forOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 52\nQ Does that help in terms of the trust the person has in you before they know you\nA Y eah Y oure saying the person that referred me to have the conversation to get the job  the person \nthat is actually going to interview you had someone from the organization saying  Hey this guy is \ngreat   So when they interview you they think of you in a better way right\nLets say someone referred you  a director or maybe a manager of another team If that person thinks \nthat would be good at working in the position that is open they will say  Hey this person knows \neverything about  or the most important things  regarding this candidate   So of course you have an \nadvantage there because its someone defending you versus a random person on the web that could \nbe a better candidate on paper or on LinkedIn but when you work with that person maybe thats \nnot the case or maybe theyre not an easy person to deal with When someone refers you you can \nbet that people are going to think that youre a good person to work with and you are going to fit the \ncompanys culture That is why in theory you are ahead of the other competitors I believe\nQ Do you think that when you are applying for a position like yours because of positions that you \nmentioned here at the beginning if its not clear what the position is  because it is not a position \nsuch as developer but a position thats a little bit harder to understand  what it does than just for the \ndescription When you have someone that you like a friend that knows you and that trusts you they \ncould even help you understand what the position is all about right\nA Usually those types of more strategic positions are the ones that are hard to find because its not \neasy to explain what youre going to be doing and what your responsibilities will be It is something \nwhere the relationship helps a lot to get Also theyre challenging roles for companies to hire for \nbecause they are not just looking for Java Python or another technology its much more than that\nQ The impression  that I have is that a position like that also pays more because it is hard to find the \nright person It is a more autonomous position where you must know what you are doing Those \npositions also pay more What do you think\nA Oh yeah for sure And if you think about it I think it is because of the responsibility In those \ntypes of positions usually your boss does not tell you what to do Usually you must figure out whats \nimportant to your company and customers Basically this is what you do I usually talk with my boss \ntwice per month Usually he will ask me  Hey what can I do to help you to do your job  Hes never \ngoing to tell me  Hey I need you to do this this and this  It is about hiring someone that is smart \nenough to figure out things that must be done and choosing the person that is going to make the \njudgment to work Because the challenge with those positions is that if youre not the right person \nyou could decide  Im not going to do the work   and then the company is going to suffer and usually \nit will take time to figure out that youre not doing what youre supposed to do That is why it is very \nhard to hire someone that you can trust at that level is going to make the right assessment of the \nimportant things that they must do on a daily basis\nQ When you get offered a position like that do you accept it or do you have to negotiate salary \nbenefits and how many hours you will work How does that work in getting a position like thisInterviews\n 53\nA Well usually as in life we need to negotiate For example I always try to negotiate my salary \nbecause it is what makes my dreams possible That is one of the things that I always try to negotiate \nAlso things that you would usually ask for such as  Hey can this be 100  remote  Or  Can this be \nflexible  Usually you need to ask One thing that people are going to figure out is that most of the \nthings that you ask for are usually things that people will allow if that is what you need to do good \nwork For example a few years ago I got one job where my ask was  Hey I would like to move from \nRio to So Paulo Would you help me to do this  And of course this was a few years ago when remote \nwork was not a reality But just for the fact that I asked my hiring manager at the time said to me  Of \ncourse lets make that possible   This was one of the things that we  agreed on when we signed the offer \nY es 100  you need to take the responsibility of asking for the things that you need to do a good job\nQ Do you have a story about a friend helping you either get a job or do something important for \nyour career\nA I have a lot of friends Usually when I am going to make a career move I ask different people for \ntheir opinion Honestly its not only about asking people to make the decisions that I need to make \nIt is more like  Hey let me see this other point of view Maybe they know something that I dont know \nabout this company   Im going to give you one example I have already worked for a few startups \nOne day I was about to make a move to another company It was a very tiny company I asked one of \nmy friends  Hey this is an American startup It seems like a healthy company Everybody is so excited \nabout working for this company So would you say that this is a good place to go now  And then this \nfriend called me  I was texting with him and he picked up the phone and called me and said  Hey \nman I would not make this move if I were you because we are going through a recession right now and \nI really believe that money is going to be more hard and this company is probably going to be acquired \nor maybe it will go broke in a few months \nIf your plan is to do an IPO that is interesting but it was maybe two or three years Because my \nfriend  and I really trust him because he has a very high position in another company  said that \nto me and I was like  Okay so Ill reject this offer   which was a great offer Then for a few months I \nwould say that I was thinking  Hey should I Maybe I made a mistake or  But then one year later \nthat company was acquired by another big company and you dont hear about them anymore And \nits not that it was bad for them  probably not But the thing was I really didnt want to do the full \ncycle of a startup and this wasnt the case with that company So yes for sure I will trust my friends \nIn the end the judgment is mine right But of course I will talk with people that I believe have the \nexperience to give me good advice Like this person who had a particularly good business view and \nprovided me with very insightful advice for sure Im going to ask them if I can I think Steve Jobs \nsaid something like  everybody wants to help you you just need to ask \nI think one of the things that has helped me a lot in my career was one of the skills that people must \nlearn  how to ask for help When I say that its like usually people will come and ask a lot of random \nthings But I would say that people will try to help you of course But if you know what you need and \nwhat you need to get from one specific person this makes it easier for them to help you For example \nI have friends whose opinions I will ask for when I am going to make a career move I will look to \nsomeone with a higher role or position such as a director or a VP  I will use them if I want to make a Optimize Your Support Network for Growth 54\ncareer move If I want to learn a new technology I have one guy who is a technical leader Right now \nhes a manager But I will ask him  Hey man with these technologies where do you see people struggling \nmore  I wont ask a VP   Hey should I learn Spring Boot 3 or should I learn React Or should I learn \nthis specific Kubernetes thing  No because theyre not good at it They are good at business They are \ngood at seeing how companies are doing Also if my friend is really good at Kubernetes and Java Im \nnot going to ask them  Hey can you help me understand whether this company is a good company to \nland right now  Y ou need to about the thing that the person is good at Make it easy for them to help \nyou If someone asked me  Hey can you help me to get a good job  or  Can you help me to get my \nKubernetes cluster working  Im going to be the person youre going to ask\nQ Now just to clarify this last point that you made there Sometimes its hard to know what another \nperson knows or does not know So how do you ask Because you said at the beginning that you \nshould ask for specifically what you need How do you ask Do you just call the person and say  Hey \nman I need this  Or how do you do it Because sometimes it is hard to ask people to help you right\nA One of the things I do is to ask people I already work with So as I said I know the type of things \nthis person would be good at So basically usually I share a little bit of background with this person \nabout the thing Im asking about Just to give an example if Im going to change companies one of \nthe things that Ill start with is  Hey friend Have you ever heard about this company I am looking \nfor a position with them or maybe I already have an offer from them I dont know whether you have \nfriends there that you can get good information from for me   Im basically trying to figure out whether \nthis company is a good company to land This is basically the type of thing that I would try to ask a \nfriend to go Y ou just need to say  Hey I need help with this Can you help me  Then the person will \nreply with a yes or maybe not right now\nBy doing this you can better prepare yourself for speaking with the hiring manager For example you \nwill know exactly what the person is looking for and can align your experience accordingly This will \nmake you more prepared and confident Additionally it instills a sense of trust in the person because \nyou understand their expectations So thats the key\nQ Thats perfect And does it also help in gaining the trust of someone who doesnt know you yet\nA Lets say  someone who refers you holds a high position such as the director or manager of another \nteam If they believe you are suitable for the open position they will vouch for you It becomes a case \nof them endorsing your knowledge and expertise in the relevant areas This gives you an advantage \nover other candidates who may appear better on paper or LinkedIn but might not be easy to work \nwith When someone refers you it implies that you are a good fit for the companys culture In theory \nthis puts you ahead of other competitors\nQ Thats awesome Especially for positions like yours which are not easily understood from the \ndescription alone In such cases having a friend who knows you can help clarify what the position \nentails rightInterviews\n 55\nA Exactly Typically strategic positions are hard to explain in terms of responsibilities and tasks \nBuilding relationships can be instrumental in gaining a clearer understanding These roles are also \nchallenging for companies to hire because they require more than just technical skills such as Java or \nPython they encompass a broader scope\nQ Right It seems like these positions may also offer higher compensation due to their complexity \nand the difficulty of finding the right person What are your thoughts on that\nA Oh definitely The higher compensation is often tied to the level of responsibility In such positions \nyour boss doesnt dictate what you should do you need to determine what is important for the company \nand its customers Its about hiring someone who is capable of identifying and prioritizing tasks This \nrequires good judgment and the ability to make the right decisions as choosing the wrong person \ncan lead to negative consequences for the company\nQ When you secure a position like this is it usually straightforward acceptance or is there room for \nnegotiation regarding salary benefits and working hours\nA Well negotiation is a common part of the process similar to other aspects of life Personally I always \ntry to negotiate the salary because it allows me to pursue my dreams Its important to ask for other \nthings as well such as remote work options or flexible hours Most requests are usually accommodated \nif they contribute to better job performance For instance in the past I asked to relocate from Rio \nto So Paulo for a job and my manager agreed to make it possible Taking responsibility for asking \nwhat you need is crucial to doing a good job In addition to money there are other factors to consider \nduring negotiations So yes negotiation is necessary for various aspects of the job offer\nQ Thats great It seems like youve received a lot of help and recommendations from friends throughout \nyour career Do you have any interesting stories about how a friend assisted you in finding a job\nA When Im considering a career move I often seek the opinions of different people Its not just \nabout relying on others to make decisions for me its about gaining different perspectives Let me \nshare an example I had worked for a few startups when I considered joining another company a \nsmall American startup in the health industry I reached out to a friend and asked for their thoughts \non whether it was a good move This friend who held a high position in another company called \nme right away and advised against it They mentioned that we were going through a recession and \nbelieved that the company might face financial challenges or even get acquired\nTheir advice turned out to be timely because about a year later the company was indeed acquired by \na larger company and faded from the spotlight While it may not have been a bad outcome for them \nit wasnt aligned with my goal of avoiding the full startup cycle Trusting my friends judgment \nconsidering their business acumen I declined the offer despite it being attractive I believe in seeking \nadvice from experienced individuals whom I trust while ultimately making my own judgment As \nSteve Jobs once said I believe that everyone wants to help you you just need to ask \nThats what I do I ask people in my network for their assistance or advice I apologize for ramblingOptimize Your Support Network for Growth 56\nQ No worries its great to hear stories like yours Do you have any other stories about community \ninvolvement negotiation or working as a postsenior Anything else you d like to share\nA Certainly One thing that has greatly benefited my career and you know this too Bruno is learning \nto ask for help When I say that I mean being specific about what you need from someone People are \ngenerally willing to assist but its easier for them if you can articulate your request clearly For instance \nwhen Im considering a career move I seek the opinion of friends in higher roles such as directors or \nVPs When I want to learn a new technology I reach out to friends who have expertise in that area \nIts about asking the right person for  the right help So I dont ask a VP about which technology to \nlearn or a techsavvy friend about the quality of a company as an employer\nTo summarize its about making it easy for people to help you by asking for assistance in areas \nwhere they excel If someone asks me for help with cooking good meat I wouldnt be the best person \nto ask because thats not my strong suit But if someone wants guidance on finding a good job or \ntroubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster Im the right person to turn to Its about knowing whom to \napproach for specific matters\nQ I see That makes sense Sometimes it can be challenging to gauge what others know or dont know \nSo how do you approach asking for help Is it a straightforward request like  Hey I need this   or is \nthere more to it Asking for help can be difficult at times right\nA When seeking help I often approach people I already have a working relationship with Since \nIm familiar with their areas of expertise it allows me to make targeted requests Let me give you an \nexample If Im considering changing companies I would reach out to a colleague and say something \nlike  Hey Friend have you heard about this company Im exploring opportunities with them or already \nhave an offer Do you happen to know anyone there who could provide valuable insights Im trying to \ndetermine whether this company is a good fit  These are the kinds of requests I typically make when \nseeking assistance Sometimes you just need to start by saying  Hey I need help with this Can you \nassist me  The person will either respond with a yes or let you know if theyre currently unavailable \ndue to other commitments\nSummary\nIn this chapter we discussed how to take responsibility for your career and how to take action \nWe shared how to actively ask for help how to listen and ask good questions how to have crucial \nconversations how to effectively negotiate with other professionals and how to take feedback in the \nright way Using these skills to optimize your support network for growth will enable your technical \ncareer to grow and thrive\nIn the next chapter we will share how to acquire the right soft and hard skills deliberately In your \ntechnical career you will need both soft and hard skills in order to succeed and continue to advance4\nAcquire the Right Skills \nDeliberately\nIn the previous chapter we talked about growing your network to support you We taught you how \nto take responsibility and take action for your career We shared how to actively ask for help how to \nlisten and ask good questions how to have crucial conversations how to effectively negotiate with \nother professionals and how to accept feedback In this chapter we will cover how to acquire the \nright hard and soft skills deliberately What really matters for developers are the skills they build in \ntheir careers There are significant differences in acquiring soft and hard skills Once those differences \nare understood it can boost your skill acquisition This chapter will discuss the differences between \nhard and soft skills and how you can practice those skills for the best results in your professional life\nThis chapter will cover the following topics\n Soft versus hard skills  the reality\n The science behind acquiring skills\n Enhancing hard skills\n Improving soft skills\n Combining soft and hard skills for maximum results\nLets begin\nSoft versus hard skills  the reality\nMany technical job  listings emphasize the need for soft skills these can be skills such as empathy \ncommunication or critical thinking In the world we live in today why do we call them soft\nThe term soft skills dates back to the US military in the 1960s when soft skills entailed anything \nthat did not require the use of machinery The term has migrated to the corporate world and is often \nmisapplied to colloquially refer to interpersonal skills or emotional IQ The demand for these skills Acquire the Right Skills Deliberately 58\nhas risen in recent years There is an assumption that these skills are easy to develop or are somehow \nintrinsic to some individuals The idea that hard skills are more important or valuable than soft  \nskills is unfortunate and soft skills are often stereotypically associated with women Employers look for \ncompetencies and critical skills and offer training for these soft skills as much as they do for skills that \nare traditionally taught as hard skills Skills are really important for our brains Every time we acquire \nskills we change the neural connections in our brains and we change the relationship between the \nneurons We physically change our brains The Talent Code  by Daniel Coyle is a book that discusses \nthe source of talent Coyle discovered that talent is not something you are born with but something \nyou develop over the course of your life Specifically talent is directly proportional to the amount of \nmyelin fatty speedenhancing nerve insulation in your brain The more you work on growing your \nmyelin the more talented you become Coyle argues that myelin is the key to extraordinary talent \nand you develop it by acquiring skills\nIf you look at the top skills reported by the World Economic Forum you can see that many are in this  \ncategory The World Economic Forum also reported that most employers expect workers to acquire \nor upskill themselves on the job to meet the demand for top skills Upskilling is the action or process \nof teaching an employee additional skills\nTop 15 skills for 2025\n Analytical thinking and innovation\n Active learning and learning strategies\n Complex problemsolving\n Critical thinking and analysis\n Creativity originality and initiative\n Leadership and social influence\n Technology use monitoring and control\n Technology design and programming\n Resilience stress tolerance and flexibility\n Reasoning problemsolving and ideation\n Emotional intelligence\n Troubleshooting and user experience\n Service orientation\n Systems analysis and evaluation\n Persuasion and negotiationSoft versus hard skills  the reality\n 59\nMost people try to acquire knowledge Knowledge is important but it is also important to support \nknowledge by acquiring skills\nSkill acquisition is a biological process it is impacted by the growth and changes of biological cells \ncalled  neurons Y ou acquire skills by practicing them deliberately Therefore skill acquisition follows \nthree biological rules that we must consider We call these rules F3\nFire\nThe first biological  rule is to fire on activate neurons What accelerates neurons is the brains process \nof adding myelin to a neurons axiom It is the long part of the cell that takes the electrical impulse \nto other neurons The faster the neurons transmit electrical pulses the more sophisticated the skills \nwe can perform\nBecause it is a biological process the brain only adds myelin to neurons that have been activated That \nis why the first F stands for focus on firing the correct neurons \nNeurons are fired when we do something not when we read about doing it or watch videos explaining \nhow to do it That means skills are only acquired when we do the skill For you to acquire a new skill \nyou must do it whether it is a physical skill such as running or jumping or an intellectual skill such \nas solving problems or software development\nEvery time you apply and do the skill you fire the right neurons The more a neuron is fired the more \nthe brain envelops it with myelin More myelin means a faster and more readytobeactivated neuron\nA neuron full of myelin can be up to a hundred times faster than a neuron without myelin A person \nthat can think or act on something 100 times faster than others will be seen as doing something magical\nForce\nThe second F is force \nThe brain tries to  save energy It tries to save resources Because of that if a neuron already performs \nat an adequate speed then there is no reason for the brain to add more myelin to it So to become \nbetter at each skill you must force the brain Y ou must force your neurons beyond their capabilities \nThat means you need to force your brain to make mistakes\nAnd that can happen in all kinds of diverse ways Y ou may need to do something faster so your brain \nis not able to catch up Alternatively you may need to do something slowly to get your brain to really \nnail the skill Y ou may also need to do something more powerfully than you have before\nForcing your neurons will force the brain to add more myelin and make your neurons fasterAcquire the Right Skills Deliberately 60\nFrequency\nThe third F is for frequency  Y ou have to  do something frequently\nIt is not enough to force the brain We must remember that underneath every skill acquisition we \nhave a biological process that takes time If we try to force it too much too soon we are not going to \ngive the brain enough time to add myelin and make the neurons faster\nConversely if we space out too much then we will not force the neurons frequently enough for the \nbrain to consider it necessary to improve So the best way is to practice frequently daily if possible \nalthough some activities might be better done once a week while many activities would be better \ndone a few times a day\nWell talk about habit creation in a later chapter but habits are usually created after 66 interactions \nwith something That could mean about two months or if you implement a habit three times a day \nit could mean about three weeks\nThis is what F3 means  Fire the correct neurons Force it and do it Frequently\nHow  do we improve our skills\nLet us think about what skills are important for us to increase our abilities Most people think of hard \nskills as technical skills and soft skills as people skills Although there is some truth to that it is not a \nsolid definition of hard and soft skills Some people believe that hard skills or technical skills because \nthey are hard  are difficult but that is not a solid definition either\nWhat are hard skills\nWe do not call hard skills hard  because they are difficult We call them hard because they are precise \nHard skills are skills that need specific precision Imagine for example typing on a keyboard\nY ou need to be very precise with your finger movements to type fast the more precisely your fingers \nmove on a keyboard the faster you type To be a better typist what you need to do is improve the \nprecision of your fingers movement  the faster your brain is able to send signals to your fingers \nthe faster youre going to be able to move them and type Typing on the keyboard is a hard skill \nInterestingly enough hard skills are indeed technical\nMany people assume that the use of the word technical  is because of technology but hard skills are \ntechnical because they involve a specific technique Getting back to our typing example there is a \ntechnique that if followed allows you to type faster and faster\nY ou start with a resting position for your hands and you use the little bumps on the keyboards to know \nexactly where to put your fingers Then you learn how to type specific letters with specific fingers \nPeople who can type with 10 fingers and are very precise with their finger movements can type a lot \nfaster than people who type with one or two fingersHow  do we improve our skills\n 61\nThis technique can be improved and there are all types of different keyboards with different key \narrangements and even separate keyboards for each type of hand All of these are different techniques \nand improvements that help you type faster and faster\nTo help you type extremely fast there are some keyboards where you dont move your fingers at all \nThey rest on the same keys all the time reducing the time that you need to move your fingers\nSo you can see that technology can improve the different techniques for you to type on a keyboard \nfaster and faster The best way for you to improve hard skills is repetition because hard skills are precise \nskills The more you practice and repeat the better you get\nWhat are soft skills then\nWe do not call  them soft skills because they are soft and easy They are called soft because they are \nmalleable Soft skills are skills that do not require precision but require malleability They are applied \ndifferently in different situations Y ou can think about soft skills as patternmatching skills\nWhen a different situation occurs there are different things that you can do different techniques that \nyou can apply or different technologies that you can use Soft skills are about experience about having \nseen and applied the skills in different situations in the past That way you know the best thing to do \nin the current situation\nThat is why we often refer to peoples skills as soft skills When dealing with people every situation is \ndifferent It depends on how the other person is responding and what your emotions are now What \ndoes this mean It means what they say and what they do When we call soft skills people skills  we \nlimit them to a specific type There are many more soft skills that are not people skills\nFor example solving problems is a soft skill Y ou may need to apply different strategies different tools \nor different mindsets to solve different problems Solving problems is something that will help you get \nbetter at problemsolving The more problems you solve the more you will improve your problem\nsolving skills although not if you solve the same types of problems repeatedly Y ou get better at solving \nproblems when you solve diverse types of problems\nThe more situations you get exposed to the better you will be in the future at solving problems \nin situations you have never encountered before Y ou may get exposed to different situations and \ndifferent complications\nThe best way to improve soft skills\nWe improve our soft skills as we improve any skills  by forcing our brains to try new things We \nshould try new things frequently and focus on activating the neurons\nWe have to make mistakes to improve our soft skills The best way to do that is to apply our skills to \ndifferent situations While repetition is also a way to improve soft skills contrary to hard skills where \nwe try to repeat the same situation over and over to improve our precision soft skills are improved Acquire the Right Skills Deliberately 62\nby applying them to different situations so that we can better understand the best ways to decide to \nuse the skill\nSoftware development which is the main topic of this book is a soft skill so improving your soft skills \ncan benefit your career in software development\nBecause we often associate hard skills with technology many people associate software  development \nwith hard skills but soft skill development involves solving different problems in different moments \nSoft skill development is very malleable Software development is a soft skill The best way for each of \nus to improve and develop is to apply a skill to multiple different problems\nWe need to apply skills to different situations different technologies different programming languages \ndifferent problems different everything Y ou do not get better at developing soft skills by repeating \nthe same thing over and over and being very precise about it\nY ou get better by applying your skills differently and of course combining hard and soft skills When \nyour skills are applied they are usually applied in combination unless you are just practicing Otherwise \nyou very rarely apply one skill alone\nFor any task or activity that you want to do or any problem that you want to solve you apply several \nskills at the same time\nWhen we apply software development we use our soft skills of problemsolving to solve problems but \nwe also use our hard skills of typing on a keyboard to type a solution in our integrated development \nenvironment  IDE We may need to use our soft skills of asking questions to understand the problem \nWe also use our hard skills of understanding a language to apply that language to the solution\nAs a technical person you should not be afraid of soft skills Y ou should shine polish and develop \nthem Many developers ask the question  How important is it to know and learn soft skills  Since \nsoftware development is a soft skill it is not only important but also fundamental The same techniques \nyou use to improve as software developers can be used to improve other soft skills\nIt is not by chance that many developers have other creative abilities such as music dancing or puppet \nmaking Many developers like to solve problems and do puzzles All these activities are soft skills\nOnce you realize this you may be freer to pursue other soft skills that you might typically shy away \nfrom doing For example negotiation and public speaking are important soft skills Developers often \nshy away from the types of labels we use to describe people with soft skills\nMany technical people avoid people skills because they think they are not good enough or they think \nthose skills will not help them improve what they do Because software development is a soft skill the \nmore we apply creative solutions to other parts of our lives such as helping our friends helping our \nfamily or helping our colleagues the more we can improve our software development\nAll these activities create experiences that we can then apply to our software development Dont shy \naway from soft skills\nHow do we enhance hard skills Enhancing hard skills requires precisionHow  do we improve our skills\n 63\nThe first thing you need to do is to determine which hard skills you want to improve To do this you \nneed to understand that if you are trying to improve a hard skill it requires precision Hard skills are \nthose skills that need to be executed perfectly every time you do them\nIf the skill you want to improve is bad if performed imprecisely and is better done precisely you know \nyou are dealing with a hard skill\nA few examples of hard skills could be the following\n Typing on a keyboard\n Writing in a programming language\n Playing the strings of a guitar\n Voice control\n Dance moves\n Karate moves\n Throwing a ball in a hoop\n Passing a ball in a soccer game\nAll of these are examples of hard skills If youre able to apply them precisely you will be very good \nat them\nThe goal of hard skills is to achieve the highest level of precision Practicing hard skills requires noticing \nsmall very incremental improvements It requires noticing the small deviance in the precision of \nperfect movements and creating a practice that allows you to get better and better at repeating the \nmove in this exact precise way\nAll the practice around hard skills involves improving this precision and improving movement When \nyou practice hard skills do not just repeat them but also create practices that ingrain the perfect move \nin your brain\nOne great way to practice hard skills is to slow down movements When you do this  it is easier to do \nthe movement perfectly and it is easy to see where you are going wrong Another important practice \nof hard skills is to speed up movements  try to do them as fast as you can which will force mistakes \nContrary to hard skills soft skills require different repetitions because soft skills are pattern matching \nand require different situations for each Y oull get experience The best way to repeat soft skills is to \nput yourself in different situations\nA few examples that might make it easy to see some examples of soft skills are the following\n Public speaking\n Having a conversation with your bossAcquire the Right Skills Deliberately 64\n Designing a user case study\n Negotiating a promotion\n Conflict resolution\nIn all those cases you deal with other people in different situations To acquire soft skills you must \nput yourself in different situations to practice the skills Y ou must change the variables With public \nspeaking for example you might speak to different audiences  a small group or a large audience \nY ou might speak live or record a video\nIt could be in a venue or remotely on Zoom you could speak using slides or have a conversation with \nthe gathered audience Y ou might do live coding or just show your slides on the screen All these \nfactors force you to be a better public speaker It is a similar case with software development you can \ndevelop a mobile application or a desktop application Y ou can write things to run on containers or \nonpremises Y ou might solve problems using Java Python or Perl\nThe more different experiences you have the better you become as a software developer It is  remarkably \ninteresting that solving a problem in your nonpreferred language helps you become better in your \npreferred language\nKey skills to develop\nHeather selected her top five skills to develop to excel in your career These are skills she looks for \nwhen hiring and in her community engagement work Y ou can improve your skills in these areas by \npracticing them with other people in various scenarios even beyond your work life such as in your \npersonal or family life These skills will help to enhance and improve your life in general as well as \nyour career\n Communication  In order to be able to progressively enhance other soft skills you need to be \nan effective communicator One of the more important aspects of communication that may \nseem counterintuitive is listening Y ou need to listen more than you speak This can be difficult \nfor many people Remember to listen or read to understand something not in preparation to \nsimply respond and put across your point of view Really try to understand what the other \nparties are trying to communicate\n Collaboration  Y ou need to be an excellent communicator to collaborate so you need to put \nthose communication skills to work Collaboration is also a skill that requires empathy and \nkindness Being kind and considering the circumstances of others is challenging for some \npeople but being cognizant of others and practicing the skill of putting yourself mentally in \nthe perspective of others will improve your ability to empathize When you improve this skill \nyou will naturally become a better collaborator Collaboration also makes you a better team \nplayer and improves your teamwork skills This is another highly valued attribute and skill that \ncan be used to hire managersKey skills to develop\n 65\n Leadership  Leaders are inspiring of course they should be in order to excel in their positions \nThe other aspect of great leaders and people with leadership skills are the aforementioned \ncommunication and collaboration skills Once you have honed these skills people will want to \nfollow you Leaders need followers People will follow others who inspire a vision  one that can \nbe communicated and that others can contribute to in order to participate in that vision Y ou \ndo not need to be given a management title to be a leader Look for opportunities to develop \na vision and enable others to succeed These are the traits of a leader\n Problemsolving  Y ou will need to solve problems in any career but problemsolving is at the \nheart of software development Solving problems and not just technical problems is a skill that \nmany developers do not continue in other aspects of their careers Think of every situation that \nyou encounter as an opportunity to solve problems Bring your communication collaboration \nand leadership style to problemsolving and step back from the immediate task at hand to \nsee the larger perspective Y ou will then find that you are equipped to solve any number of \nchallenges coming your way\n Conflict resolution  If you can be relied on to resolve conflicts that will inevitably arise in your \ncareer you will find yourself in high demand Assuming you have developed the aforementioned \nfour skills you will put your communication collaboration leadership and problemsolving \nskills to work to resolve nearly any conflict Coming to an agreement that will amicably meet \nthe needs of all parties  maybe not completely but at least partially  is possible Finding \ncommon ground where there is agreement can help to resolve the conflicts that arise in software \ndevelopment teams Being someone who can be relied on with the  ability to bring people to a \nplace of commonality is something that will make you valuable to not only management but \nalso your team members\nCombining hard and soft skills for maximum results\nCombining soft and  hard skills delivers maximum results Always remember that every skill is a \ncombined activity It is a combination of multiple skills There is almost nothing that requires only \none skill There is almost nothing that is all hard skills or all soft skills Y ou must combine hard skills \nand soft skills To learn about a technology you will need to practice deliberately and incorporate your \ngood habits to repeat and implement the learning Y ou will need to take action and practice every day \nin order to develop the skill and establish a habit\nIn her career Heather does quite a bit of hiring and offers recommendations for hiring technical \ntalent She will often reference a quote by Simon Sinek about the person with the best people skills \nwinning and she has found in her own experience and those of other hiring managers that when you \nlook for technical talent or it is time to make a decision about a new role you will not look for the \nperson with only the best coding skills you will look for someone who has a combination of superior \ncoding combined communication collaboration and critical thinking skills as well as emotional \nIQ or emotional intelligence and the ability to understand use and manage emotions in positive \nways The ideal candidate is someone who will be a positive team member and the hiring manager \nwill often choose a candidate with a lower level of coding skills in order to have a candidate who can Acquire the Right Skills Deliberately 66\ncombine coding with soft skills As Heather says echoing Simon Sinek she will choose the one with \nthe people skills every time The powerful combination of hard and soft skills will give you maximum \nresults in your career Take the steps to build the practice and habit of acquiring a combination of \nhard and soft skills in your professional life\nInterview\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta  Heather thank you very much Im super excited about this opportunity\nMy name is Arun Gupta I am the vice president and general manager of the open ecosystem team \nat Intel\nA few years ago if somebody had asked me if I saw myself working at Intel in this job I would have \nnot even imagined it and Im very grateful to all the wonderful people that Ive been surrounded \nwith the impact that the community has had on me over the years and all the good wishes that I \nreceived that got me here\nNow Im not discounting all the technical work that Ive done over the years with multiple communities \nIve been fortunate  over the last several years Ive been paid to come and work for a nice big company \nand that is only possible because essentially I was doing a lot of work out in the community  blogging \nwriting authoring a book giving keynotes all over the world in more than 50 countries I think thats \nbeen a big part of my career over the last few years\nAlthough all of that was done in a classical DevRel role over the years Ive shifted away from DevRel \nand toward open source strategies Thats the reason I was at Amazon I was doing DevRel but also \ncreating open source strategies for different service teams at Amazon There was a lack of knowledge \nabout how open source operates That was also the reason I was hired at Apple Apple built an open \nsource program office Now at Intel the open source program office is one part of my team but I have \na bunch of other folks who do DevRel out in the community\nI see myself as a chief storytelling officer  I go out in the world and tell people why open source \nmatters to Intel Its about understanding what the current landscape of the company is and telling \ncustomers out in the real world why and how we do open source Thats the part that I enjoy the most\nOver the years technical skills have definitely been a big part of it but equally important are nontechnical \nskills Y ou need to consider soft interpersonal skills  when you are communicating with somebody \nhow well are you listening to them Are you even listening to them or are you trying to interject \nwith your point without letting them complete their thought Are you truly being helpful to them\nIn an open source world conflicts happen all the time On average we have to do conflict resolution \neight times an hour  how should I word this email Should I send the email now or in 20 minutes \nShould I take a break now or in 20 minutes We do conflict resolution constantly and when there are \nother human beings involved it becomes all the more complexInterview\n 67\nHow you do conflict resolution in the open source community is important My approach to it is this \n is it a task conflict or a personality conflict A task conflict is about what and how a personality \nconflict is about who Separating the two is important because it is what allows you to move forward\nReturning to the communication side you need to be very mindful of when you talk In the open \nsource distributed world there may be childcare parent care pet care and other things going on in \nsomeones life to consider Y ou may be driving as youre listening to someone on the phone and go \nthrough a dead zone where there is no cellphone signal meaning you might have heard only part of \nthe conversation Y ou need to make sure your intended impact on the listener and the actual impact \non the listener are aligned so you should be very mindful when you talk\nOn the listeners side you need to truly try to understand as opposed to interjecting Once youve \nlistened you need to paraphrase and reply back  This is what it sounds like youre saying  Dont try \nto smuggle your point of view into it just understand the other persons point of view and then you \ncan put your point of view across As Stephen Covey says most people do not listen with the intent \nto understand but with the intent to reply Dont try to reply just try to understand\nThe other thing that I often talk about is adaptability The last three years have taught us how important \nadaptability is We lost some loved ones but on the whole humanity has survived and the only reason \nits survived is that we adapted Such pandemics occur once every 100 years We all bunkered down \nNobody liked it People had all sorts of different issues but we didnt die humanity didnt crash\nThats the exact same thing that happens in technical communities as well Y ou have a new boss Y ou \nhave a new tool Zoom has a new feature Y our internet goes down Change is the only constant How \ndo you adapt to these everchanging conditions Y ou were using Java now youve got to understand \nNET Anything could happen The ability to mark your adaptability quotient is vital\nIn terms of the adaptability quotient what do you look at Y ou ask the following questions  how can \nyou unlearn and relearn quickly How do you adapt to failures How do you recover from failures \nAre you genuinely curious about the situations that are given to you Do you get bogged down or \nthink  OK here is the thing that is not working I need to get this working  Therefore adaptability is \nanother nontechnical skill that is very important\nI used to travel all around the world and our flights would change schedules all the time Maybe you \ncant reach a conference youre supposed to speak at Maybe youre crossing into a different time zone \nHow do you handle the circadian rhythm of your body Change is the only constant and adapting \nto that change is what makes you thrive\nWeve talked about communication Weve talked about conflict resolution Weve talked about \nadaptability The fourth skill that I believe is highly undervalued is kindness and gratitude  kindness \nto yourself and kindness to others Y ou cannot be kind to other people without being kind to yourself \nAnd what is kindness Kindness is an act of helping somebody or giving a compliment to somebody \nwithout expecting a returnAcquire the Right Skills Deliberately 68\nSay you are walking along the street and realize that somebody dropped something from their backpack \n you just go and pick it up and give it back to them Thats kindness Its humanity as well but its \nkindness too Say you are waiting in your car at a traffic light The traffic light goes green but someone \nis taking their time to cross Y ou dont honk at them  you let them cross Say somebody did a favor \nfor you at work Y ou were new at work and they helped you to understand how something worked \nThats an act of kindness That is exactly the element that is missing We can only be more kind\nPlus as I said be kind to yourself Lets say that in a meeting or a talk you find youre not performing \nwell Dont get sulky and bogged down by it so much that it bothers you for the next few days Its OK \nto make mistakes Everybody makes mistakes Nobody has ever been perfect all the time Think to \nyourself  OK You know what I messed up Maybe I didnt prepare well or maybe I should have done \nthings differently  Be kind to yourself and then give space and grace to others\nAs for gratitude be thankful for what you get Often we say  Oh I wish I did that differently  Sure \n hindsight is 2020  but be grateful for the things that you have and dont wait for the big moment \nto happen Dont think  When the release happens or when the conference is over then Ill be grateful \nto the people that helped me achieve them \nIn my team meetings we always start with a gratitude checkin  What are you grateful for  People \ncome up with all kinds of gratitude stories  I was trying to do a talk to these people They were not \nunderstanding my point of view Then a person stepped in and they conveyed my point of view in a \ndifferent language and they understood it What a wonderful gesture  or  I was trying to debug some \ncode I couldnt understand it and then this person stepped in and they helped me succeed  These are \nboth acts of kindness but being grateful for those acts and explicitly conscious of them is important \nThats the fourth skill of being kind and grateful\nMaya Angelou said that people will forget what you did and what you said but they will never forget \nhow you made them feel Kindness only makes you happy It brings more meaningful connections at \nwork It increases your serotonin dopamine and oxytocin These are the hormones in your brain that \ngive you happiness And with kindness and gratitude particularly what goes around comes around \nbecause if I perform an act of kindness that makes you happy that makes me happy and then it makes \nthe people who encounter it happy as well Overall theres greater happiness\nThe fifth skill that I could talk about briefly is mindfulness That is very important Mindfulness is living \nin the present moment without judgment If you think about it oftentimes we are not in the present \nmoment We are often worried about things that have happened in the past or anxious about the future \nneither of which is in our control Y ou can regret the past but can you change it No Is the future in \nyour control Y ou can be better prepared for it but its still not in your control The current moment \nthe current breath that youre taking is the only thing in your control Neither the past nor the future \nis in your control Y our response to the past and the future is the only thing that is in your control\nLet me give you an example Y ou try to fall asleep at night lying in bed What goes on in your head \nY ou think about how the day has gone  This was good that wasnt so good  Alternatively youre \nworried about whats going to happen the next morning  Oh my meeting is coming up and thats \ngoing to be difficult  Again you try to live in the past or the future while you try to fall asleep and Interview\n 69\nthen an hour goes by  youre not able to fall asleep Y ou need to live in the present moment  let go \nof the past and let go of the future\nMindfulness gives you the ability to reduce anxiety It helps you deal with the current situation Ajahn \nSumedho a Theravadian monk based out of Thailand summarized mindfulness in five words He \nsaid  Right now its like this  Its not about me or you Its about the current situation If you want to \nbe mindful in a situation that is stressful think to yourself  Right now its like this  Y es the water \nshould not have been spilled Y es you should have done a better job of putting safeguards in place \nRight now its like this How do you make progress and move on Because that gives you a perspective \nthat you can deal with\nAll of these skills have been vital for me growing up as a person and being really able to interact that \nmuch more impactfully with the Java community which Ive been in for 25 years\nThose are the five skills that are extremely valuable and that we need to focus on How do you make \npeople feel Are you being aware Are you being mindful Are you able to do conflict resolution Are \nyou aware of cultural biases gender biases and unconscious biases I think all of those elements are \nvery important if you are a younger developer particularly Y ounger developers typically have a lot of \nimposter syndrome walking into a room and thinking  Oh my God This guy has 25 years experience \nand is so good I could never get there I dont belong here  Well he has 25 years experience and you \nhave 2 years experience In 23 years you will certainly get there  no question about it\nDont have imposter syndrome Be kind to yourself Just have the courage to ask the right questions \nand then thatll help you grow overall If you continue to live with imposter syndrome it will never \nhelp you grow My advice to young developers or indeed people at any stage of their career is to \nnever have imposter syndrome\nBe fearless but dont be stupid Theres a fine line between being stupid and fearless but be fearless \nTry to build connections in the community Forge a network in the community and see how it helps \nyou grow\nQ Awesome Can you share a little bit about how getting involved in the community helped your \ncareer in the early stages Y ou developed those skills and realized they were important How did that \nimpact your career\nA We used to give JavaOne keynotes I have keynoted JavaOne for seven consecutive years In a \nJavaOne keynote adaptability is so important If the system is not working how do you adapt Y ou \nneed to do a talk with another speaker That speaker wants to add their agenda and you want to add \nyour agenda  how do we resolve that conflict How do we communicate How do we adapt\nMore importantly I dont want to be the person who right after the keynote just walks out I never \nwant to work with that person Thats where kindness and mindfulness come in Giving the JavaOne \nkeynotes opened up a lot of opportunities for me Being a kind person being a grateful person Acquire the Right Skills Deliberately 70\nand being able to resolve conflicts in an amicable manner opened up a lot of opportunities because \npeople saw me as a person that they could invite to other conferences That helped me build a DevRel \nplatform and gain visibility\nNow similarly I am part of the CNCF governing board As the governing board chair its very important \nthat I am unbiased and able to talk to all types of people All five skills I have talked about have been \ncritical for my growth and living a more contented life Growth and contentment are different things \nIn your current role are you satisfied Are you having fun Are you happy\nAll of these skills have been fundamental Y es Ive had the technical skills all along but I can very \nwell imagine that without any of these soft skills I would not have grown I would not be here without \nany of them\nSummary\nIn this chapter we talked about learning the correct hard and soft skills deliberately Y ou should now \nbe able to identify the diverse types of skills know how to acquire skills reliably incorporate practices \nto acquire hard skills as well as soft skills and also know how to practice these skills in real life\nIn the next chapter we will discuss how to operate outside of your comfort zone5\nStepping Outside  \nY our Comfort Zone\nIn the previous chapter we talked about how to acquire the hard and soft skills necessary to advance \nyour career In this chapter we will help you learn how to get out of your comfort zone The most \nimportant thing to focus your mind on involves taking action Learning improving and growing are \ndifficult things that require deliberate focused effort If you do too little nothing happens If you push \ntoo much you give up This chapter will present strategies for you to keep pushing in a consistent \nmanner We will give you the specific steps required to force your brain to take action find the right \nbalance and acquire consistency in continuing to push yourself outside your comfort zone\nIn this chapter well cover the process to do the following\n Force your brain to take action\n Find the sweet spot\n Be consistent\nLets begin\nForcing your brain to take action\nWe have to appreciate the fact that taking action is very difficult It is difficult for our kids and for our \nteam It is difficult for us\nMany bosses think that you can force people to act or at least convince them to do it But forcing  and \nconvincing a subtle way of forcing  is counterproductive When people recognize we are forcing \nthem they react against it\nOur brains work the same way Maybe you experimented trying to be your own boss  thinking you \ncan force yourself to do things But when you try to corner your brain and be a tyrannical boss with \nyourself your brain reacts with fear Y ou procrastinate Y ou find excuses and reasons not to do thingsStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 72\nLeaders recognize the fact that forcing is the wrong way and instead inspire people to take action \nInspiring is helping people to decide to act\nThat works for us also Here is a fourstep process that you can use to inspire yourself into taking \naction  and achieving your most important goals\n Step 1  Create and visualize a great future\n Step 2  Maximize the current problems\n Step 3  Build a bridge from here to there\n Step 4  Plan small actionable steps\nStep 1  Create and visualize a great future\nTo take action you  need to see a clear and better future one that you want to be part of one that you \ncan see yourself living Thats because our brains need a clear image to act upon The more detailed \nthe future we see the more invested we will be in trying to achieve it\nThe industry knows this very well and uses this to inspire us Y ou can go to an Apple store and hold \nand use iPhones MacBooks and iPads Y ou can hold them in your hands and see yourself owning one\nWhen you go and buy a car the salesperson invites you for a test drive Y ou drive the car and make \nit your car long before you make the real decision about acquiring it When buying a house the real \nestate agent walks with you inside a furnished house and they help you visualize your kids playing \nin the garden Those things make our future decisions more real Y ou can see yourself living in your \nhouse driving your car and programming on your laptop\nWhen you experience  yourself within that future life you are more inclined to take action to make \nit a reality Y ou can use those same tactics but to create and achieve your most important goals\nImagine how your life will be once you achieve the desired results See yourself enjoying an event \nwhen you are there as a speaker Visualize your day as a recognized software architect Create a clear \npicture of your life when you are working every day on this new technology you want to learn\nThink of yourself in your amazing future What are you doing How are you feeling How do people \naround you interact with you How is your family enjoying it The more detailed you see yourself \nliving in this future the more you will be inspired to take the needed actions\nY ou should remember one important thing Talking with technical people just like you it is amazing \nhow much we only focus on our careers and professional life Although this is a book about your \ncareer you will advance much faster and build a better life if you visualize a future for your whole life\nMichael Hyatt in his book Your Best Year Ever  lists 10 areas where you should make plans for your \nfuture to help you build the life you wantFinding opportunities within our limitations  the sweet spot\n 73\nUsing the following list write down what would be an amazing  year for you in at least three areas of \nyour life Bonus points if you can imagine how you want to be in all the relevant areas\n Spiritual  How will you connect with the sacred and transcendent This includes religion \nmeditation and mindfulness\n Intellectual  Learning and improving including books courses and training\n Emotional  Taking care of yourself including dealing with stress anger management \nand selfknowledge\n Physical  Feeling good with your body including exercise weight control hygiene and health\n Marital  Y ou and your significant other including time together and joint projects and activities\n Parental  Focusing on your family including your parents or your kids projects and vacations\n Social  Friends and entertainment going out and traveling\n Vocational  Y our work and career including plans to grow positions and career dreams\n Avocational  Y our hobbies and free time including sports side projects and fun stuff\n Financial  Y our money and security including investments savings and side hustles\nOnce you have created a vision for your future in some or all of the preceding areas let us focus on how  \nwe can find the sweet spot to find a way to bridge between the vision of our future and the limitations \nthat may prevent us from realizing that future\nFinding opportunities within our limitations  the sweet \nspot\nWhen you  imagine a better life in the previous areas and describe your amazing future it is normal to \nnot immediately believe it is possible We limit ourselves to prevent taking risks or putting ourselves \nin discomfort\nThe way the brain does that in our daily lives is by creating a sense of fear That is why it is helpful to \nthink far ahead a year from now It helps to subdue this fear so you can think clearly But this subdued \nfear does not disappear It can show up as anxiety a knot in the stomach\nWhen you were writing down or imagining your future did you feel anxiety about some of the things \nWhen you think about committing yourself do you feel a knot in the stomach such as negative ideas \nor the feeling that this is impossible and you are unable to commit to that future\nTake note of those feelings They are what we call limiting beliefs  things that you believe about \nyourself or your life that limit your possibilities Write them down Try to put into words what you \nbelieve is impossible\nRecognizing the limiting belief is the first step to overcoming itStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 74\nNow that you have listed the things that limit you you can create liberating truths that can help you get \npast your limiting beliefs Note that limiting beliefs are real They are things you believe about the world \nand about yourself and your situation Because they are real you get stuck and cannot overcome them\nThe only way to free yourself is by thinking of liberating truths That is not simply a motivational \nstatement made to convince you Liberating truths are true statements that you also believe in but \nthat allow you to move forward\nHere are some examples\n Limiting belief  I dont have the time to do all that Ill be too busy during the year\n Liberating truth  I can prioritize my activities and reduce time spent on things that are less \nimportant to be able to find some time to focus on the most important dreams and goals I \nwill be busy but I can choose to be busy with the right things\n Limiting belief  I dont have the money to do those things\n Liberating truth  I can look for free alternatives and I can find some extra revenue doing \nsome side job I can do this because achieving those objectives and goals is the most important \nthing this year\nLiberating truths put YOU in control of your life They dont make the problems and fears magically \ndisappear but they help you see there is something  however small  that you can do about it\nStep 2  Maximize the current problems\nHaving a clear vision of your future will help you create the motivation to take action however this \nalone is not enough\nHow many times have you created or seen your friends create New Y ears resolutions How many \nof them get dropped or forgotten even before January ends We create excuses and reasons to not do \nthings that we think are important\n I dont have the time\n I dont have the money\n My boss wont let me do this\n My company will never help me\n I cant My wife this my kids that\nTo help us overcome those excuses we need another push We need to see our current reality and realize \nthat staying put is a bad idea We need to see our current situation and have a clear understanding \nthat we cant continue to live like this We cant continue to not take action\nWhat happens if you dont go after your dreamsStep 2  Maximize the current problems\n 75\nIf you continue to repeat the thing thats not working\nIf you keep on the same loop of not getting what you want\nRecognizing our  current situation our limitations and our fears is the key to overcoming them Lets \ndive into your current situation Get a pen and some blank paper or open up a notetaking app\nSpend time thinking and mulling over your past by answering the following questions\n How did you expect the past year to go Try to think about what you wanted for the past year \nand what you expected to happen\n Did you have any plans for the past year\n Were you expecting any breakthroughs or results\n Any New Years resolutions or lists of activities and dreams When writing things down try to register \nthe feelings you have about those dreams Do you get excited sad or uneasy about something\n What were your goals and dreams if you had any\nRegister any specific goals that you had planned Note whether they were detailed or vague Also \nmake notes on how far you got on each goal\nAlso about your dreams dreams are usually less specific than goals but they are also larger and more \ninspiring Write down your past dreams and whether you took any specific actions on them\nWhat about disappointments or regrets While thinking about your goals and dreams note the things \nyou got disappointed about and things you regretted It could be things you regret doing or maybe \nregret that you missed the opportunity It can be accomplishments that you expected would be amazing \nbut turned out to be disappointments It can also be feelings of guilt and selfbashing for not taking \naction or maybe taking the wrong path\nWhat do you feel you should have been recognized for but werent These can be things you did and \nno one noticed Maybe because no one even knows about them or because they imagine it was luck \nor their own doing and dont realize you were behind it\nSometimes we do things at work or for our families that are very important but invisible such as \nwhen we dont buy something or we work extra hours and save money making other things possible\nIn other moments someone else gets the credit maybe by design such as when you want someone \nelse from the family to get the credit but sometimes by ignorance or even malice when someone fails \nto credit you because they dont know better or they take the credit\nWhat are you proud of List the things you are happy that you did and that you feel proud to have \naccomplished Sometimes we are proud of having given our best even if we didnt achieve it allStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 76\nWhat are the recurring themes Now it is time to look back at your notes Are there things that kept \nrepeating Feelings or difficulties that are similar Reasons for failure or successes that go round \nand round\nThose repeating themes may be things you need to stop or maybe the things you need to go ahead \nand finish\n What do you think\n What are the life lessons\n If you could list some lessons that you can take from your life from the past year what would they be\nList 10 things you are grateful for Gratitude is one of the most powerful feelings and it can push \nyou to your next challenge List as many things as you can that you are grateful for Small things big \nthings List all you can and take some time to act on this gratitude if possible\nHidden opportunities Look back at all you wrote here Sometimes our biggest opportunities are right \nin front of our eyes and we dont see them They are hidden in plain sight\nAre there things you can focus on and get done quickly to get a big win from the start Do you see \nrepeating patterns that you can either break or benefit from\nHere are some ways that will help you identify hidden opportunities\n Look for things that you started but didnt finish Sometimes its one step away from good results\n Think of friends and partners who can help you overcome a problem or a situation\n Align objectives by asking yourself are there several points or issues that build on each other\n Identify repeating issues that if you fix them can open lots of possibilities\n Spend some time looking at everything What pops out at you\nStep 3  Build a bridge from here to there\nY ou now have clear dreams and understand you cant stay put Congratulations This is more planning \nthan most people do for their lives\nBut it is still not enough One of the reasons it is so hard to take action is that we are very adaptable \nNo matter how bad the situation is we adapt and are able to survive\nTo prevent our fears from paralyzing us we need to believe we can go from where we are to where \nwe want to be We need to believe we can become who we want to become\nFor that we need to build a bridge  a bridge that can take us from where we are right now to our \ndesired future A bridge is basically the steps that will take us from our limited problematic situation \nof today to our amazing life in the futureStep 3  Build a bridge from here to there\n 77\nBuilding the bridge\nIn order to build the bridge it can be helpful to consider the different areas of your life Think about \na few of these areas listed next and consider what needs to happen in order to get you to your desired \nvision of the future What concrete results need to happen in each of those domains What would \nneed to happen in these domains for you to consider that the year was amazing Turn your vision \ninto specific things that need to happen for you in a few of the following areas\n Spiritual\n Intellectual\n Emotional\n Physical\n Marital\n Parental\n Social\n Vocational\n Avocational\n Financial\nY ou can use the specific things that need to happen in these domains to create objectives and actions \nto take Now that you have a list of objectives you need to make them effective Great  goals follow \nthe SMARTER pattern Evaluate every goal for your year Make sure they check every point Having \nexcellent goals will help you achieve them\nSMARTER goal template\nCreate goals that  are SMARTER as follows\n Specific  Goals have to be specific and focused on a clear result\n Measurable  Y ou must be able to track your progress\n Actionable  Make your goals focused on actions\n Risky  Make them larger and push yourself to achieve more\n Timekeyed  Whats the deadline That will keep you focused\n Exciting  Make them amazing and fun so you want to achieve them\n Relevant  Are they aligned with your vision for the futureStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 78\nStep 4  Plan small actionable steps\nNow you have created goals and objectives you have an amazing dream for your future Y ou know \nyou cant stay where you are Y ou even have a plan Maybe you are now very motivated to cause a \nchange in your life and take action\nNothing can stop you now\nWellmaybeSo many people have all of that and still dont get to the other side and stay stuck\nWhy Y ou see the issue here is motivation Motivation can only take you so far Its a great catalyst \nfor change and can get you started But real change takes time And motivation is tiring and not very \nuseful to keep us going during all the time needed for change to happen For real change you need \nconsistency Y ou have to make sure you have small steps and create the right habits that will get you \ndoing the needed things long after motivation has run out That is the only way for you to cross to \nthe other side of the bridge step by step by step\nTwo types of steps\nThere are basically two types of steps that we need to create\n Steps\n Tactics\nSteps are single actions that we do once Steps will make us move closer to our dreams and we will \ntick them off our list as Done  Steps are things such as Create an account on a blog platform  Once \ndone we move to the next\nTactics are strategies things we do many times until we get results We focus on doing tactics every \nday or every week to move closer to a goal Tactics are things such as Write a blog post for 5 minutes \nevery day \nBoth steps and tactics require that we keep doing things and keep pushing ourselves to take action \nevery day\nBe consistent\nTo keep doing things we will apply the SCIENCE of sticking with it This is explained in detail by Sean \nD Y oung in his book Stick with It A Scientifically Proven Process for Changing Y our Lifefor Good \nHow can you maximize your chances of sticking with it and how can you get to the end result It is \nnormal to get lost in the goals along the way But you can plan and create the conditions that will help \nyou stick with your goals and give them a better chance to succeed For each of your steps and tactics \napply the SCIENCE of sticking with it The way to use this is for each goal think of strategies to \napply at least three or four of the following ideas For the most important goals apply all of themBe consistent\n 79\nSTEPLADDERS  small steps\nOur brains go into  crazyfear mode every time we try to commit to something that seems to be too \nbig or too dangerous That causes all kinds of selfsabotage against our plans such as procrastination \nlack of motivation and fear of success\nThe way to prevent that is to plan for small steps Very small steps For example if your goal is to write \na book this may seem impossible or too hard for you\nSome people divide the work into small steps such as a plan to write just one chapter or one page \nevery day But even that seems implausible and causes anxiety so we never start\nThe solution is to start even smaller Commit to writing just a single paragraph or even a single \nsentence every day This may seem too small to create any results but research shows that 80 of the \ntime once you get started you will do more than that minimum\nAnd here is the magic the hardest part is to start Reducing fear will allow you to start doing Once \nyou overcome that fear the impossible becomes possible\nCreate a COMMUNITY\nWhen we have other people doing things with us we are more likely to pull through We have increased \ncommitment because we see other people depending on us We also feel like we are part of a group \nwhich is more fun and increases our motivation We create accountability within the community\nThink of ways that your goal could be done together with other people Maybe they are doing similar \nprojects or everyone is working on the same project Y ou can plan things such as going with friends \nto a networking event or creating a joint open source project It could also be something as simple as \njoining a challenge on social media where many people are trying to achieve the same goals\nDoing things together with others also helps with consistency It is harder to miss a day of running \nif you know your friend is waiting for you It is more probable that you will log in to GitHub if you \nschedule a time for hacking together with a friend\nNow one little piece of advice Sometimes we think that more is better Well there is a known \npsychological phenomenon that if there are many people involved especially if they are strangers \nwe reduce or even eliminate our need to take action So if there are 100 people going to an event you \nmay think that you dont really need to be there\nSo when creating a community choose a few people that will actually hold you accountable\nAnd make sure you hold them accountable too\nMake it IMPORTANT\nMotivation is not  sustainable in the long run but it is really important as activation energy to get the \nprocess startedStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 80\nWhen we are doing something that we feel is important we stay committed for longer giving a better \nchance for the habit to settle in\nMake your goals important Connect them to the most important things in your life\nDo you want to learn a new programming language Make it VERY important Think of the connection \nthat exists between you learning it you getting a promotion or a raise and how the extra money will \nallow your family to go on that amazing trip together\nConnecting your daily activities to larger more important goals will help you to focus and overcome \ntemptations But most important connecting your goals to your larger dreams will give you the \nmotivation to do the other things on this list\nRemember that motivation is a flimsy expensive activity Use motivation to get everything else ready \nto be consistent\nMake it EASY\nLife is already complicated enough Sticking with your goals is very hard and taking action is \nunbelievably difficult Why are you going to complicate matters even more Dont Make it as easy as \nyou can Lets take Bruno as an example\nI wanted to write every day and for that I needed to be on my computer Not only did I have to deal \nwith a lot of distractions but some days I was tired already in bed or out of the house with no \ncomputer to type on Sticking with it was hard I tried to overcome that by typing on my cell phone\neven harder Stop Why do this to yourself\nI acquired a Bluetooth keyboard Now when I need to write I can just grab the cell phone and type away \nThat simple tweak made my writing totally consistent and I have been writing daily for months now\nThis also connects with the small steps At night before you go to bed your brain is not worried that \nyou will go out for a run So it will be no problem for you to put the running clothes on the side of \nthe bed In the morning when you are sleepy and looking for excuses to not get up to run the clothes \non the side of the bed will make it easier for you to go and run\nLook at what you want to do Can you make it easy Can you make it easier to do it than not to do it \nThats the way to go thats planning\nApply NEUROHACKS\nA neurohack is  a hack on your brain Our brains are biologically hardwired to do things in specific \nways If to achieve your goal you need your brain to function differently than it does it will turn into \na tugofwar Guess who wins every time Y ep your biological brain So you need to understand how \nthe brain works and do things in a way it is willing to do Get your brain on your sideBe consistent\n 81\nAll the items on this list are already working with your brain such as stepladders so your brain doesnt \nfreak out or making it easy so its easier to do than not\nOne extra neurohack you can implement is getting your brain to want  to do things The commonsense \nidea tells us that the way our brains work is like this I think that I want to do something so I go and do it \nAlthough this is what most people believe this is not true We are habitdriven creatures our brains \nprefer to keep doing what we already do and will resist anything we want thats different\nThe truth is that our brains function like this Since I do this thing I must be someone that does this \nso Ill continue to do it \nIf you try to do something different your brain will resist On the other hand if you try to do something \nyou already do your brain will go along with it\nThe neurohack is to understand that this is how our brain works and instead of fighting with your \nbrain and getting upset just let it continue to believe it has the situation under control Do you want \nto do something thats important for you and you dont like it or procrastinate on it Start small very \nsmall So small your brain doesnt really consider it a threat because it is nothing at all\nIts almost not doing it So its almost as if nothing changed Then keep this a little more than not \ndoing for a few days That will become your new normal Y our brain will catch up and will start \nfunctioning as if it always wanted to do that This is the basis of the saying fake it till you make it look \nat someone that you admire or someone that you aspire to be more like and start doing what they do\nWant to be a great runner What do great runners do Run every day Do the same Start small maybe \njust 1 min of running but do the same and run every day\nWant to become a great developer What do great developers do Do they code every day So you \nstart  writing code every day even if just for a few minutes or just a few lines of code\nSoon enough writing code every day is the new norm and your brain will miss doing it Thats when \nyou become who you want to become\nCAPTIVATING  make it rewarding\nAnother thing  that our brains love is to receive a reward Thats why its so easy to get into addictive \nhabits such as smoking or looking at the phone every time it beeps\nOur brains love the rewards of those activities even when they are detrimental to our health our \nproductivity our job or even our sanity We can use the love of rewards to our advantage\nWhen you plan something look for ways to add captivating elements to it\n Can you make it fun\n Can you turn it into a gameStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 82\n Can you add a reward to the end of it\n Can you just be playful and imagine something\nLets explore some ideas\n Make it fun  Plan to do it with friends or in a place you like Invite your significant other to join \nyou so you can work together or at least side by side Put on some great music that you love\n Turn it into a game  Try to beat yourself Use a Pomodoro timer and try to finish before it \ndings Create a personal score rules and points There are even apps that add gamification to \nour daily lives\n Add a reward to the end of it  Promise yourself a good reward such as an ice cream or 30 \nminutes of a video game It can be simply doing something you love going for a walk jumping \nin the pool adding a few pieces to a jigsaw puzzle giving a hug and commemorating with \nsomeone you love\n Be playful and imagine something  Just imagining can do wonders to make it fun Imagine \nyou have to finish this to be able to close the bridge before hordes of orcs will gain access to the \ncastle Imagine you are running from zombies and  you just have to do one more lap to get to \nsafety Oh The path is blocked One more lap and you can reach the helicopter\nSounds silly\nBut it is fun And it works Y our brain will happily go along with it and you will accomplish a lot \nmore and feel a lot better\nENGRAINED  create routines\nAnd last but  definitely not least you have to do it over and over\nThat does not sound like fun but done together with everything we said so far it can be\nHere are a few things that can be very helpful\n Do it at the same time every day Not necessarily at the same time in hours or minutes but \nafter a common activity such as right after you open your laptop for the first time or when \nyou finish pouring your coffee\n Set a timer or a reminder on your phone\n Use a habittracking tool to remind you to do it\n Force yourself to do it for a few minutes every dayBe consistent\n 83\nDo it after something else you already do such as after brushing your teeth\nOne that is used very frequently which is both a game and an everyday thing is Jerry Seinfelds \nsocalled Productivity Strategy  It is easy mark on a calendar with an X every day you do the activity\nhabit The idea that you cant break the chain of Xs will help you try a little harder And you will try \nto beat it every day making an instant game\nThe best performers in the world make daily practice its own reward Just doing it every day becomes \nthe reward you are looking for That spirals into greatness\nMake your move\nY ou have a fantastic  dream for your future and you are clear about where you want to get\nY ou understand your current situation and how bad it is to stay here  for you and for the people \naround you Doing nothing is not an option\nY ou have a bridge Y ou have a plan that is actionable it is realistic but it is also exciting and challenging \nY ou know it will take effort but you can do this\nLast but not least you mapped out small steps They are small enough to prevent your brain from \ngoing nuts with fear but are sure enough to get you across this bridge\nHere are Scott Thiago and Nikitas views on the topic\nScott Wierschem\nBruno Souza asked me to help with the Java Community Keynote at JavaOne This was my first \nJavaOne so I was very intimidated being around all of these industry leaders It turns out I have a real \nskill for developing a story and arranging a skit It was a big hit and Ive been asked back to help with \nthe Java Community Keynote every year since and Ive gotten to meet industry leaders all because \nI stepped outside my comfort zone\nThiago Bomfim\nI worked for 5 years in the same company Mirante Tecnologia which became Singular  an amazing \ncompany where I learned a lot  but I think I was in my comfort zone I was facing new challenges \nbut nothing that made me afraid\nFurthermore I received a proposal to go abroad and I accepted it It was not easy but I learned a \nlot  Im still learning  and with this opportunity and with my mentor I became able to grow faster \nin my career and receive better opportunities\nThis is my story of how I got outside my comfort zone and how it helped me to grow more in my \nprofessional career and personal lifeStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 84\nNikita Koselev\nI spent five years working at the same company an exceptional organization from which I gained \nsignificant knowledge However I came to realize that I had become too accustomed to my routine \nand was not facing any truly intimidating challenges\nThen an overseas opportunity presented itself which I ultimately embraced despite its difficulties \nThis decision has been a continuous learning experience for me and thanks to this chance and my \nmentors guidance Ive managed to accelerate my career growth and access improved prospects\nIn essence my journey like Thiago involves stepping beyond the familiar and into the unknown \nwhich has greatly contributed to my advancement in both my professional journey and personal life\nFinal lessons\nIn this section well go through some final lessons before concluding the chapter\nEmbrace failure\nThe thing to know about stepping outside of your comfort zone is that as you grow and evolve so \nwill your comfort zone As you step outside of it and become comfortable with things that made you \nuncomfortable in the past your comfort zone will extend into that area Y ou will need to continue \nto journey to go further and step outside of your comfort zone again As Heather likes to say get \ncomfortable being uncomfortable This will allow you to grow And you may be afraid but it is okay \nto have some discomfort when you overcome your fears To quote Aristotle  He who has overcome \nhis fears will truly be free \nWhen you embark on a journey to overcome your fears and step outside of your comfort zone there \nwill be failures Y ou can learn to embrace failure and learn from each failure as each failure will bring \nyou things on the other side of that failure  lessons learned wisdom and knowledge And failure \nis often a part of the process of stepping outside of your comfort zone It is only through trying new \nthings that you will achieve the things you want on the other side of fear and potential dare we say \npromised failures along the way Embrace the journey process and lifestyle of continuously stepping \noutside of your comfort zone Just as we talked about continuous learning we believe in continuous \ngrowth in your career path\nAlong the way there will be resistance in the form of many things or excuses and most commonly \nprocrastination We get in our own way with procrastination\nProcrastination is when we delay put off or avoid doing something Most people face this at some \npoint in their lives even when there are negative consequences to doing soBe consistent\n 85\nHow to avoid procrastination\nThere are significant  benefits to embracing discomfort and as you embrace this activity in your life \nthink about the role of your mindset in overcoming challenges The ideas we are talking about fall \ninto a growth mindset A growth mindset centers on the belief that you can improve your talents and \nskills over time The opposite is a fixed mindset or a set of limiting beliefs that you cannot learn and \nimprove your capacity over time In addition to a growth mindset the other mind shift that can be \nsignificant in advancing your career is the power of now In the New Y ork Times bestselling book  \nThe Power of Now  Eckhart Tolle talks about living fully in the present This concept the power of now \nis a powerful one One of the most prominent quotes of this book is  Realize deeply that the present \nmoment is all you ever have Make the Now the primary focus of your life  If you focus on the present \nand act with immediacy in the present you will be able to grow and advance continuously in your life \nThis is easier for some people than others It has been studied and found that people who are highly \nconscientious do not procrastinate as much as others Even if you are not highly conscientious there \nare steps you can take to limit the amount of procrastination in your life\nIn the paper by Schrager S Sadowski E Getting more done Strategies to increase scholarly productivity  \nJ Grad Med Educ  2016811013 doi104300JGMED15001651 there are several tips laid out \nfor overcoming procrastination These tips include developing a schedule planning and improving \ntimemanagement skills\n Make a plan  To help keep you on track create a schedule action items and lists with \ncompletion dates\n Chunking  Break down the items into smaller and more manageable steps to avoid large tasks \nthat may be overwhelming\n Watch for warnings or triggers  Pay attention to thoughts of procrastination and if you feel \ntempted to procrastinate proactively spend some time working toward your plan\n Distraction  Think about and eliminate sources of distraction such as social media scrolling \naimless time scrolling through your news feeds or timelines watching television and so on\n Celebrate small wins  Congratulate and reward yourself when you accomplish a task you have \nplanned on time\nIf you bring the power of now to your life with a growth mindset and reduce procrastination there \nis no limit to the things you will be able to achieve on your career path Opportunities will open and \npresent themselves to you It is your responsibility to be ready to welcome them and achieve your \ncareer goals and dreamsStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 86\nInterview\nScott Wierschem\nQ Scott can you quickly introduce yourself\nA My name is Scott Wierschem Ive been doing software development for about 40 years Ive been \ndoing Java development for 20 years\nMy forte is working on legacy systems old crusty code that most people are afraid to dig into I like \nto find ways to get in there and make it maintainable\nI have a project I call the Keep Calm and Refactor project Its a mentoring program to help developers \nwho have got some experience but need help to become better at handling legacy software development \nas thats really what most of us are going to be working on for most of our careers If you can be good \nat that you will have a much more enjoyable career in software development Thats what lights my \nfire these days\nQ Thats awesome One of the things that you do is help developers not only deal with legacy code \nbut actually to become better developers Y ou practice the skills and technologies with them in depth\nA Y es I help them to understand the value of the fundamentals Testdriven development is one of \nthose skills that are hard to develop and so I work with developers to help them develop that skill \nso that they can then take it to their regular work and become better developers who are constantly \nlooking for ways to do better work and make work more enjoyable We enjoy work more if were really \nexercising and developing our skills\nQ Do you think working outside your comfort zone is important for developers to improve their skills\nA Its essential Y ou cant improve your skill set if you keep doing the same old stuff If you go back \nand look at code that you wrote a year ago and youre not embarrassed then youve not developed \nas a software developer If youre going to stay within triedandtrue things that youre familiar with \nyoure not going to learn new things\nFor instance in Java I know people who still dont know how to do lambda programming Thats been \nout since Java 8 Its the same with streams This is stuff thats been around for many years but some \npeople just dont understand it yet Y oure really limiting what you can do Y oure not taking advantage \nof how to make your software development better by learning the latest features of the language that \nyou work with every day Y ou need to go through the pain of feeling  Im not familiar with this  \n I feel like an idiot trying to figure it out   And then you spend the time and you learn how to do it \nand realize  Oh yeah This was so easy Why was I thinking it was so hard  Well because it was hard \nWhat you did was hard but you worked on it every day sometimes for years Its OK to struggle with \nsomething thats new because thats how you become better at what youre doingInterview\n 87\nQ But its also scary to put yourself in a position where as you said you feel like an idiot and you \ndont know what to do Thats very scary\nA Its especially scary if youre going to do it on your production work thats not the way that you do \nit What you should do is do the scary stuff where you feel like an idiot someplace else  on an open \nsource project or some tutorial that youre working on at home\nY ou have to invest in your career in your time Y ou cant necessarily expect your employer to do that \nfor you Y ou can go to conferences and learn about stuff Y ou can buy books work through tutorials \nand have friends who can help you but you have to spend some extra time doing it and not expect \nyour employer to train you\nThere are some employers who will help you learn new things but you cant expect that Y ou cant just \nsay  Well if theyre not going to train me then forget it Im not going to learn   Its your career Y ouve \ngot to take control of your career\nI like to tell people a story about the woman who cuts my hair She was cutting my hair once and \nsomeone came in one time selling scissors for cutting hair and she said  Oh yeah Those are the \ncheap ones Theyre only 200 dollars   I said  What  It turns out that she goes to barber conferences \nto get the nice shears for cutting hair and theyre about 500 dollars  for a pair of scissors And were \nwhining about spending 150 dollars for an IntelliJ license Get over yourself I pay her 15 dollars \nto cut my hair I get paid more than 30 bucks an hour I should be able to afford the tools that I use \nand the training that I need to keep myself up to date She doesnt have her employer sending her to \nbarber conferences She sends herself to barber conferences and she pays outrageous sums of money \nfor these tools and she has to pay to keep them sharp Y ouve got to pay for the tools you use and the \nlicenses for the tools that you use Y ouve got to support the online open source projects that youre a \nfan of Living your life for free is a losers way to approach your career\nQ And in the same way that she needs to keep her tools sharp you also need to keep your tools sharp\nA Absolutely In the same way that she goes to conferences learns new techniques and subscribes to \nmagazines to see different hairstyles and keep up with what people are interested in Ive got to make \nsure I keep up with the latest technologies techniques and best practices in my industry Thats just \nwhat a professional does and its up to me Its not up to somebody else to make sure that I learn it \nNobody cares about my career more than me Not even my mom cares about my career more than \nI care about my career\nQ Do you have any stories of how working outside your comfort zone actually helped you in your \ncareer Is there anything that you can remember that happened to you that shows the value of working \noutside a comfort zone\nA At some point I realized that I liked working on legacy systems and that I wanted to do that So \nI talked to you Bruno and you gave me some advice on how I can find other people who are doing \nthis sort of thing and make it a part of my careerStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 88\nI discovered that theres a community that meets on a regular basis to discuss things with respect to \nworking on legacy code and I met the author of a tool called Approval Tests I met him and he talked \nabout this cool tool that he has I started playing with it and found that its an exceptionally useful \ntool Ive become a big fan of it\nAt first I struggled with it for months trying to figure out how it worked  I knew that I wasnt using \nit right Finally a year or two later I was able to catch up with him again I told him how frustrated I \nwas trying to use it because I knew that it had all kinds of great features but I couldnt figure out how \nto do it right He said  You know what I need to improve the documentation on that and you are in \nthe ideal situation to help me with that \nNow I have been meeting with him for two hours every week working on improving the documentation \nI bring my ignorance and he brings his experience and were able to help each other Im able to help \nhim make the documentation better and hes helped me to understand the product better and vastly \nimprove my software development skills through pairing with him to make changes to the application \nto improve it so that we can make the documentation work better\nThis is one of those 10x developers He charges maybe 800 an hour for his consulting fees Hes a \nvery indemand guy and I get two hours of his time once a week That has been absolutely amazing \nin helping me to advance my career\nQ Thats great Whats his name\nA His name is Llewellyn Falco and he wrote the Approval Tests open source tool\nQ Cool Do you have any advice to help people become better developers and improve their skills Is \nthere any advice that you want to give the people reading the book who are trying to improve themselves\nA There are a thousand things I could say\nThe first thing that comes to my mind is that if you take ownership of the work that you do so that \nyou take pride in making sure that what you turn in every day is of the highest quality that will make \nall the difference It will make you want to learn more about how to do things better It changes how \nyou approach everything that you do so that you start to care about the little things such as spaces \nversus tabs This affects how the team works together Its something that we all need to work together \nand communicate Are we going to adopt a testdriven approach How are we going to do our unit \ntesting We need to agree on how were going to do this and we all need to make sure that were doing \nit in a way thats effective for our team for the product and most importantly for the users If I write \nsomething thats really fun and cool to work on but nobody uses it it doesnt matter  Im still going \nto lose my job Y ou need to create value and take ownership of making sure that everything that you \ndo every day creates value for your employer and for the end userInterview\n 89\nQ Nice Y ou mentioned that you love to do legacy code and that you actually help people understand \nlegacy code There is a perception in the industry that legacy code is bad  that it is old technology \nthat wont help your career Why do you think working with legacy code is important for developers\nA Well first off theres a lot more legacy code out there than there is new code And frankly once \nyouve been working on something for a week or even a couple of days its already started to turn \ninto legacy code Like I said if you go back and look at code that you wrote a year ago and youre not \nembarrassed then youre not growing and you should be growing every day\nOne of the big advantages of legacy code is that it is already creating value for the company The company \nis making money from it and so its a critical piece of the companys profitability Its important that \nit keeps working well and that you are able to enhance it in some way\nNetscape was far and away the best browser in the industry and they decided that the code was too \nugly They said  Were going to go and rewrite this sucker from scratch   That became the Mozilla project \nwhich is now far behind Google Chrome Now the industry  even Edge  has decided to build on \nthe engine for Google Chrome That is what everybodys using Why did Netscape lose that edge \nBecause they decided  Oh were going to throw away all the learning we had over the years start from \nscratch and make all those mistakes again  Thats a really expensive way to go\nBeing able to maintain legacy code and work with legacy code adds a tremendous amount of value to \nyour skill set and if you can find ways to make it interesting then you will have much more enjoyment \nin your career There isnt a whole lot of greenfield software development out there where you get to \ngo and make all the decisions for how everything works Generally someone else has already decided \nwhat the database is that youre going to use Someone has already decided what language youre going \nto use Someones already decided on your framework and your libraries Sometimes even the IDE is \nforced on you If you can find ways to work within the parameters that are given add value and make \nthings interesting and fun then youll have much more joy in your career youll be much more effective \nin the work that you do and youll be able to bring a lot more value to the table People will notice\nQ Cool\nA We only do refactoring if were maintaining existing code or adding new code which is all the \ntime when youre doing testdriven development red green refactor Thats adding new code When \nyoure going in to fix a bug youre effectively refactoring something to correct a problem When youre \nenhancing an existing system youre going to have to go and refactor it in some way so that you can \nplug in the new functionality\nSo yes refactoring  we use it all the time Thats why I call my project Keep Calm and Refactor \nbecause refactoring is a critical skill set Y ou can never completely master it but there are always new \nways for you to enhance your skills Thats what I like to help people doStepping Outside Your Comfort Zone 90\nQ Cool Let me go back to working outside the comfort zone I know that you have a great talk about \nreading code Thats such a basic skill for developers Can you work outside your comfort zone when \nreading code which seems like such a basic easy thing to do\nA Reading my own code is easy because I wrote it and I know what I was thinking when I wrote it  \nunless I wrote it a few months ago or a year ago in which case I go back and say  What was I thinking \nBut when Im looking at someone elses code and Im trying to understand it I often dont understand \nwhat they were thinking Ill say  Thats a stupid thing to do Im going to go do it the right way  But \nyou can develop the skill of going in and reading others code understanding how its doing what its \ndoing and getting into the mindset of the developer who may no longer be around Y ou can develop \nthat skill and think  OK This looks like a design pattern and so this is the design pattern they were \nputting in place   or  This is a function that they needed to implement to make sure that these other \npieces all work properly We had to have this initialization step put in place in a particular way to make \nsure that it would all follow correctly \nBeing able to do that quickly and effectively makes you a more effective developer and makes you \nmuch more valuable because you can quickly get into some unfamiliar code and understand how it \nworks Y ou can go and make a change or instruct someone else on how to make the change properly \nY ou can do code reviews and say  OK These are areas that are going to be potentially problematic and \nwe need to look at Lets find ways that we can make that a little bit better before it gets pushed into the \nproduction code \nReading code is a skill that we really need to work on and develop Its something that we just dont \ndo because it is hard and  for the most part  not enjoyable unless you can find a way to make it fun \nThe way that you make something fun is to start to develop a skill in that area and then when you \nexercise that skill and develop it in some small way thats what makes things fun Its fun because Im \nlearning how to implement an algorithm in a slightly different and better way than I did the last time \nI tried to do this or Im learning a new tool or a new feature that makes it much more interesting to \ndo what it is Im trying to do Thats what makes software development so much fun Its because were \nconstantly learning a little bit more and you can do the same thing with reading code\nI get excited about this because its a skill that is neglected but as you start to develop the skill it \nreally can be a lot of fun Its neglected because its hard and not fun just like learning objectoriented \ndevelopment was hard when you first learned it Y ou just dont remember how hard it was Functional \ncoding was hard when you first learned it Y ou just dont remember how hard it was Everything we do \nwas hard when we were first learning it but youve got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable \nand realize  If I learn a little bit every day eventually things are going to start falling into place Summary\n 91\nSummary\nThis chapter has been all about getting out of your comfort zone Y ou have learned the four steps to \ntaking action the correct way to work out of the comfort zone strategies for being consistent and \nthe science behind consistency as well as the most important aspect of consistency These skills and \nstrategies will enable you to be able to continue to expand your skills in your technical career\nThis concludes Part 1  of the book on learning and practicing technical skills In Part 2  we will focus on \nthe next set of skills that will help you to advance your technical career one that is often overlooked \nY ou will learn how to get involved and how to participate in the community In the next chapter we \nwill start with how to become a team player by embracing communitiesPart 2  \nGet Involved Participate  \nin the Community\nAlthough developing your technical skills is a great step to have an amazing career you need to go \nbeyond the technical Software development is a team effort and being able to work together with \nothers is a requested

beyond \nthe technical Software development is a team effort and being able to work together with others is a \nrequired skill that puts you at the next level Theres an African proverb that goes like this If you want \nto go fast go alone If you want to go farther go together  Y our career development is a long game We \nare not here for a fast short sprint but for the longterm results This part of the book will prepare \nyou for the long run\nSoftware development is a team effort It is one of the most multidisciplinary jobs and requires many \ndifferent professionals Because of all that developer communities are not only the place to meet and \nnetwork with other developers and keep up to date with the latest innovations in technology but also \nthe place to practice collaboration communication and teamwork skills\nIn this chapter we will discuss the value of communities Well cover the following main topic in \nthe chapter\n The value of communities\n Identifying communities of relevance to your career\n Participating in communities to increase your networking\n Building internal communities\n Leading external communities\nIn this chapter we will help you to identify communities that are relevant to your career By the end \nof this chapter you will have learned how to participate in communities to grow your network and \nimprove your networking Y ou will even learn how to build communities of your own whether they \nare internal or external communities And finally you will understand how you can lead communities \nwherever they may be  internal external virtual or in personBecome a Team Player by Embracing Communities 96\nThe value of communities\nA community is a  group of people gathered over a common interest either in person or virtually \nCommunity is inherently about people People connecting with each other provides an opportunity \nfor us to exercise and deepen our humanity Technology is also about people People use and create \ntechnology Technical careers are about technology and they are equally about people Technical \ncommunities also provide opportunities to increase our technical proficiencies and expand our \nnetwork and leadership skills\nIt is timeless wisdom that by working together we can achieve more and a community provides leaders \nwith connections and opportunities that cannot be achieved in isolation In Heathers presentations \nshe often draws on the idea that you can participate as an individual but by working together as a \nteam  you can achieve more This is the essence of community and the power that it provides If you \nwant to succeed and advance in your technical career you will need more than the technology and \nskills we identified in Part 1  of this book you will need other people working in collaboration\nIdentifying communities of relevance to your career\nY ou know that both of us are passionate about Java technology This is the technology we have chosen \nto build our careers around  or Java chose us One thing is certain and that is Java moves our world \nOnce you determine the technology you are passionate about you need to spend time understanding \nhow that technology is utilized and how it is developed and evolved\nFor example we know that Java helps you to stay safely and securely connected with your friends and \nfamily Think of any industry or technology and youll see Java  from banking health commerce \ngaming insurance and education to quantum computing artificial intelligence blockchain and many \nmore It is everywhere As a trusted ecosystem Java has adapted to changing developer and business \nneeds and continues to be relevant and popular Java continues to be at the top of the rankings of \nprogramming languages used by companies and developers For example the TIOBE Programming \nCommunity index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages The index is updated \nonce a month The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers worldwide courses and \nthirdparty vendors Popular search engines such as Google Bing Y ahoo Wikipedia Amazon \nY ouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings It is important to note that the TIOBE index \nis not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code  have been \nwritten The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to \nmake a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to \nbuild a new software system\nWhere in the index is your technology of choice used and how is it used Once you understand this \nthink about how and on what platform the technology evolvesIdentifying communities of relevance to your career\n 97\nAs you know GitHub is where most developers worldwide collaborate to write source code GitHub \npublishes results on the projects being developed there in the GitHub survey results Y ou can also look \nat reports for future trends RedMonk a popular industry analyst tracks programming language usage\nThe results are a product of combining GitHub activity and contributions with Stack Overflow \ndiscussions to come up with a correlation between use and discussions We know that Java  continues \nto be popular in current and future adoption trends\nIt is important to know where your technology is in these trend reports This is useful to help you \nnot only decide about new technologies as we discussed in Part 1  of the book but also identify the \ncommunities that will continue to be popular and worthy of your time investment If you see your \ncommunity performing well in these areas you can safely plan to invest time\nOnce you have identified technologies  that you are using and that are also performing well in developer \nusage and trends start to investigate how those technologies are developed Are they developed by a \nsingle company or a consortium of companies Are they developed in an open source project Who \nmaintains the technology and what is the process for evolving it\nWith respect to Java part of its success can be attributed to how the language has evolved and how \nthe developer community is collaboratively involved in the evolution Th  e Java Community Process  \nJCP prog ram is the process by which the international Java commun ity standardizes and ratifies \nthe specificat ions for Java technologies The JCP program ensures highquality specifications are \ndeveloped using an inclusive consensusbased approach Specifications ratified by the JCP program \nmust be accompanied by a reference implementation to prove the specification can be implemented \nand a technology compatibility kit a suite of tests tools and documentation that is used to test \nimplementations for compliance with the specification\nExperience in the Java ecosystems has shown that the best way to produce a technology specification \nis to use an open and inclusive process to codevelop a specification and implementation informed \nby a group of industry experts with a variety of viewpoints This also includes giving the community \nand the public opportunities to review and comment and a strong technical lead to ensure technical \ngoals and integration with other relevant specifications and user expectations\nThe JCP program is overseen b y an Executive Committee  EC representing a crosssection of both \nmajor stakeholders and other members of the Java community that is responsible for approving the \npassage of specifications through the JCP programs various stages and for reconciling discrepancies \nbetween specifications and their associated test suites Every year the membership of the JCP program \nelects the members of the JCP EC\nAfter being introduced in 1999 the JCP program has continued to evolve over time using the process \nitself to bring significant benefits to the community and to specifically focus on transparency streamlining \nthe JCP program and broadening its membership With many changes in the Java community the \ncontinuation of the JCP program remains constant Anyone  can apply to  join and participate in the JCP \nprogram  either as a corporation or nonprofit full member Java User Group partner member or \nindividual associate member The stability of the JCP program  and participation from community Become a Team Player by Embracing Communities 98\nmembers ensures the continued success of the Java platform and its future Standards enable the \nexecution of technical strategies and the JCP program enables the collaboration of companies and \nparticipation from the developer community\nHow has your identified technology evolved and does it have processes you can identify This can be \na great starting point for figuring out which communities make sense for your career\nJoin a group that resembles a place where technology evolves  it is like being a citizen of the technology\nJoining is the first step after you have identified a community Sometimes there may be a process or \nrecommendation required in order to join but we will cover that in the next section about participation \nAfter you join the community or communities you have identified you will then be able to determine \nother communities that you can participate in and also build and lead those communities\nParticipating in communities\nOnce you have identified  communities it is time to start participating Y ou cannot reap the benefits \nof a community by being silent and only observing within the community To enjoy the benefits \nyou need to participate and contribute Y ou identified and joined the community  that is awesome\nCongratulations That is only the beginning Now comes the more challenging aspect of figuring out \nhow to participate This can be daunting and overwhelming at times In all our combined years of \nexperience all of us have experienced some form of imposter syndrome It might be easier to just call it \npart of the human condition Imposter syndrome is the persistent belief that our own accomplishments \nor our own success are not due to our skills or efforts but given to us through some sort of mistake and \nthat at some point we may be found to be an inexperienced fraud who does not belong This can also \nsometimes lead to anxiety about being placed in certain situations such as a community of peers\nSince both of us spend time talking to developers from all over the world we have observed that \nwhen the discussion gets to participation in and contributions to a community the response is often \nsomething such as I am not good enough  I am not experienced enough  My feedback is not important  \nor My opinion does not matter \nNothing could be further from the truth In order for technologies to be successful architects and \nmaintainers need realworld developer feedback They need this feedback from people just like \nyou  people with diverse backgrounds use cases and experiences and levels of experience As we \nmentioned the Java Community Process  JCP is the  organization that defines the Java specification \nstandards The largest companies in the world are part of it and collaborate to evolve Java technology \nThe Executive Committee has representatives from corporations open source and nonprofit groups \nJava User Groups and individual developers At the meeting we had top developers such as Brian \nGoetz the Java language architect Mark Little Red Hat representing IBM Mala Gupta JetBrains \nMartijn Verburg Microsoft representing the London Java Community Chandra Guntur NYJavaSIG \nrepresenting BNY Mellon Ivar Grimstad Eclipse Foundation Simon Ritter Azul Miro Wengner \nMission Control developer and so many other amazing people Remember what we said about Participating in communities\n 99\nimpostor syndrome The feeling that you dont deserve to be where you are Thats the feeling that \nwe get in the EC meetings\nWhen you look at such a group full of Java Champions developer advocates distinguished engineers \nCTOs and open source developers it is amazingly easy to believe it is impossible to participate  \nimpossible to be there \nNow if you want to grow beyond seniorlevel positions getting involved with such a group will give \nyou several skills that are important for the next steps in your technical career Not to mention the \nvisibility and networking that can really push your career to the next level Does even thinking about \nbeing part of such a group trigger all your impostor syndrome neurons\nOne thing is sure it poses a dilemma Do you acquire the skills to be part of groups like this Or \ndoes being part of groups like this allow you to acquire the skills As with almost everything in our \ncareers it is not an eitheror  It is actually both Y ou BOTH  acquire the skills to be part of groups like \nthis AND  being part of groups like this helps you to acquire the skills In your career things build on \ntop of what you did in the past\nY our career is a spiral not a straight line One thing that especially amazes me is that when you look \nback at the JCP meetings you see so many of the members being part of them Some  participated \nin Java specifications Others helped with the open source implementations of those specs or joined \nspecial JCP working groups Some were elected to be a part of the JCP Executive Committee or won \nJCP awards Y ou can see how the dilemma worked for them They built the skills Being part of it \nbuilds their skills And they are still building their skills Skills are like this  you are always improving \nthem And participating in communities helps you improve\nAlong with imposter syndrome there is online criticism or disapproval This can be difficult to accept \nand sometimes it can be personal There are a variety of tactics for handling these and you can see one \nexample by Ann Friedman on her website The Disapproval Matrix  httpswwwannfriedman\ncomthedisapprovalmatrix \nHeather often advises developers who want to get involved and participate in communities to follow \nfive steps\n1 In the community you can help each other and work together Identify the project you want \nto work on Think about either a project you are working on or a project that is in an area you \nwant to work in Maybe there is a project that has a dependency on one of your projects Have \nyou ever heard the phrase scratch your itch  Think about an area that can help you to alleviate \nthat itch in your career or solve a problem you are currently facing\n2 Join the mailing list of the project and browse the archives to get familiar with it\n3 Express your interest in participating either on social media or by subscribing to the mailing \nlist Download draft releases or first access builds  run your applications against them and then \ndiscuss them and provide comments If you need sponsorship or mentorship to get involved \nin a community this is often one of the best ways to demonstrate your interest and potential Become a Team Player by Embracing Communities 100\nvalue to be in the community For example the Java language and platform evolve in OpenJDK \nand as part of the Quality Group and there is also the Quality Outreach group These are great \nplaces to get started to be able to contribute as a beginner\n4 Y ou can support Free and Open Source  FOSS  Java projects and keep up to date with the latest \nrelease of Java There are over 100 projects currently participating in testing new Java versions \nTwo examples of projects participating that have found new contributors via this program are \nApache Maven and Eclipse Collections\nCommunicate to identify tasks\nRemember to communicate with leaders and maintainers and other community members or contributors \nParticipation in a community is a twoway street  it is vital to communicate your experiences and \ncollaborate on the next steps\nIf you do not have direct access to communication you can communicate with leaders on public \ndiscussions and issue trackers\nTake action\nOnce you decide on the next steps commit and take action to contribute Follow through on your \ncommitments This will help to strengthen your relationships and build trust in the community Here \nare some suggestions that we often hear from project leaders or contributors\n Share ideas and feedback and comment on lists and public issue trackers\n Read early versions and share feedback on specifications and documentation\n Download and provide feedback on early access reference implementations\n Try writing sample applications using early builds of reference implementations\n Write or speak about technology and encourage others to participate Translate it into your \nnative language\n Evangelize the JSR  via social media blogging or lightning talks\n Help with documentation\nContribute the actions to others\nIt is important to share your feedback and follow up to share your agreedupon contributions \nAlways remember that the leaders of a project make the final decision on incorporating feedback or \ncontributions For projects that are further along new feature requests may not be considered for \nthe current release but they may be considered for future releases For projects in the early stages \nnew features may be accepted if they are within the existing scope Multiple individuals and groups Communicate to identify tasks\n 101\ncan and should  collaborate on a particular project There is always plenty of work and going through \nthe material multiple times only makes it that much better When communicating with maintainers \ncontributors or expert group members on mailing lists include a recognizable tag in the subject line \nand when filing issuesbugs and always use the same recognizable tag so that it is easy to track your \nprogress and contributions\nHave fun\nIt is easy to realize at this point that you are having fun in this process of getting involved in the \ncommunity What may have seemed daunting at first is now second nature and you are enjoying \nthe relationships and results of your efforts  At this point take the time to take the following steps\n Sharing your results and having fun in the process is a key component of participation in \na community\n Update your GitHub CV or resume and LinkedIn profile to include your community participation \nand contributions Be specific about your contributions and list the names of the projects and \nhow you have participated or contributed\n This is realworld experience that will be valuable to your growth in your career Y ou can add \nskills you have developed especially the types of skills we discussed in the previous chapter \non hard and soft skills\n Share your experiences with colleagues and on social media as well This is an opportunity to \nshape your social media participation and build your following We will discuss this in more \ndetail in a later chapter on social media\n Sharing on social media helps both to provide exposure to the project and to your personal \ncareer and accomplishments\nThose are the basic steps to participating and contributing to a community Follow your interests and \nneeds communicate do your research participate contribute and share by communicating your \nresults and having fun\nY ou can grow organically from there to continue to expand and deepen your relationships in the \ncommunity and grow your influence\nAs you continue to participate and contribute you will observe your skills are evolving and your \nnetwork is expanding\nThis is the topic of the next section\nParticipating in communities to increase your networking\nWhen you take the initiative to be part of a community you are also part of the solution Y ou will \nacquire knowledge and learn from experts and gain early access to the latest and greatest technologies Become a Team Player by Embracing Communities 102\nThis will allow you to get your projects into production faster and allow you to put your suggestions \nand requirements for projects forward\nY ou will build your resume by adding experience and skill development This also helps you to grow as a \ndeveloper increasing your practice of communication collaboration negotiation and teamwork skills\nIn turn this will increase professional visibility through your CV  articles workshops and presentations \nWhen you participate you grow your reputation and your network\nIt can be altruistic to make technologies better  technologies that solve realworld problems  based \non realworld experience\nMost of all being part of a community is fun\nBuilding communities\nOnce you have  experience participating in communities and you have seen your network grow \nexponentially the natural evolution and inclination may be to build a community Whether or not \nyou decide to build communities of your own these techniques can be applied to your advanced \nparticipation in communities and to further strengthen and provide feedback to community leaders\nThese suggestions can be utilized if your community is an internal corporate community for employees \nor if your community is external to your employer In todays climate communities happen in a \nmultitude of environments  internal external virtual or inperson\nY ou can adapt techniques to fit your particular community\nWhen you are ready to initiate a community take the time to define a strategy and target audience \nIt is often tempting to dig right in and start taking action when the motivation strikes to build a \ncommunity however it will be helpful to define a strategy and parameters and to be able to qualify \nyour target community members\nThis will also help guide the participants in your community\nNext will be building the components to launch and manage the technical community and \nassociated technologies\nSome tasks include a definition of technical community values establishing the legal foundation of \nthe technical community the definition of member personas of the community the definition of \nhow to lead manage and engage the community and the launch of the technical community with \nan operational plan to maintain the community\nAs you plan build and grow your community these are important values and points to keep in mind\n Listening to community members is key Creating a mechanism for your community members \nto give you feedback is required Receiving feedback is not the end you must then take it \ndiscuss it and act on it in an iterative way This seems easier than it isLeading communities\n 103\n Invite people to join your community As people join your community give them easy pathways to \nbridge the chasm from interested in joining to being a fullfledged member of the community\n Make sure that you are actively communicating with your community Not everyone is going \nto see the changes and understand what you are doing for example leadership architecture \nor license choices In this case explaining the why will go a  long way to keeping your \ncommunity engaged\n It is rare to have one size fit all for members Think about how to make it easy for different types \nof people to contribute whether its different membership categories or different activities \nIt is easy to assume that its an open community or an open source project so everyone just \ncontributes There will be different people who want different things\n As you evolve stay true to your values Always be conscious of these values Be deliberate in \nthe changes you make Stay true to the values of the community and communicate\n As you look at evolving the governance structure look at the governance structure as a living \nand breathing thing Keep up with the needs of the community members This should be a \nconstant ongoing consideration\nThese are the core guiding principles to keep in mind as you build your community Now lets talk \nabout  leading communities\nLeading communities\nOnce you have built your  community you will need to lead your community Or perhaps you are part \nof an existing community and you have been invited to assume a leadership role in the community It \nis recommended to ensure the longevity of communities that you have a leadership pipeline\nIf you want to be a leader of an existing community tell the current leadership This is an opportunity \nto grow your leadership abilities There are some tips that will help you understand how you can lead \ncommunities wherever they may be  internal external virtual or in person Always remember that \nmost community projects receive far fewer contributions than they would like\nThink of the 8020 rule In many aspects of life 80 of the work is done by 20 of the people Often \ncommunities are volunteers or additional projects for individuals so when life or work becomes \nhectic or overwhelming the community can languish A healthy community will have a leadership \nteam to prepare for these circumstances and a pipeline of emerging leaders to pull into the leadership \nteam over time Some communities even build in term limits or elections to ensure the health of the \ncommunity in the long term\nWhen you are leading a community choose the right technology and people for your team The \ntechnology platform should fit the needs of your vision for the community This is not something \nthat you want to be constantly updated or changedBecome a Team Player by Embracing Communities 104\nIt should provide mechanisms for feedback communication and transparency Can the public \nand members of the community view information on the project download and view drafts view \nschedules view and contribute comments on issue trackers and view and provide feedback on mailing \nor discussion lists\nThe communitys leadership reflects your values and principles Define the values and principles of \nyour community and regularly reflect to ensure that the leaders of the community are a representation \nof those values and principles\nConsider drawing from the community to champion these values by providing a designation of \nrecognition such as influencers champions experts or ambassadors\nSelect the right people to champion your community Provide them with a designation and a process \nfor engaging along with tangible benefits for engaging and participating Y ou will need to engage \ndiverse types of community members from varying geographies different sizes of companies and \norganizations nonprofits educational institutions students and so on\nY ou can start with a target that fits the community you are building but as you lead the community \nbe thoughtful about how you will continue to remain vibrant and relevant\nIn the Java community for example there is an initiative started within the JCP to bring up the next \ngeneration of Java developers to ensure that the technology continues to be popular and taught as a \nlanguage of choice to younger or more junior developers and students\nConsider the overall lifespan and health of your community members as you grow and lead them \nover time Are there levels of recognition that can be provided or ways to highlight their current \nstatus and tenure in the community How can they build on their participation and contributions to \nthe community over time\nFinally select the right online community features to build your membership  to lead and keep a \ncommunity engaged you need regular content and material that is relevant and a regular cadence of \ncontact with your community either through online or inperson meetings\nSelect the cadence and format that works best for your members Communities should meet at regular \nexpected times  whether that is daily weekly monthly bimonthly or even annually Look for ways \nto build connections between regular meetings through other forums such as message boards mailing \nlists social media Slack or your website\nSome communities meet every week and some meet once a month or less frequently Experiment to \nfind the frequency that works for you and the format that works best for you Incorporate different \nelements into your online or inperson meetings  formal presentations informal presentations \nnetworking job referrals hack days and outreach to other communitiesChallenges of participating in communities\n 105\nChallenges of participating in communities\nOf course as with anything you endeavor to do in life there are some challenges and potential \ndrawbacks to participating in communities While we wholeheartedly believe that these challenges \nare overwhelmingly worth the reward we will provide some guidance for you to consider as you \napproach your engagement in communities There are sometimes choices and challenges you will face \nas you begin to participate in a community such as the time involved and balancing your community \ninvolvement with work responsibilities Y ou can determine the time commitments you make to \ncommunity engagements but it is important to balance those commitments with your work and \npersonal or family obligations There is immense value in participating in communities but you need \nto be mindful to meet your obligations in your work and personal life to achieve results and rewards \nAnother challenge that can arise is actually a positive that you may recall from earlier in the book and \ninvolves conflict resolution When you collaborate and engage working together conflicts inevitably \narise In order to be successful you need to be skillful in successfully managing and resolving conflicts \nwithin communities Develop your communication skills and learn how to work together with other \npeople to bring any potential conflicts to an amicable resolution\nBuilding strategies for managing time and setting priorities will help you to eliminate the potential \nfor time management difficulties The first thing to do is to evaluate where you are spending your \ntime Document how much time you are spending on the different areas of your life and identify the \npriorities Determine whether there are priority areas where you are not spending enough time Avoid \nmultitasking Studies have shown that your brain is not meant to do more than one thing at a time Y ou \ncan do more than one thing at a time but it is not efficient and you will waste valuable time Y our brain \nspends energy switching between the different tasks and priorities Focus on one thing at a time Y ou \ncan use application features to focus such as do not disturb and set calendar appointments in your \nschedule to block out time for specific activities comparing them to your priorities and evaluating \nhow you are spending your time on the different areas of your life\nY ou can plan in advance to develop strategies for conflict resolution First of all recognize and \nacknowledge the conflict Ask questions and listen to all parties to understand the problem or issue at \nhand  this is where your communication skills will be critical Discuss and clarify the issue to come \nup with possible solutions and do this in a relaxed and neutral environment without distractions for \nexample outside of work or the community gathering place Listen and communicate with all parties \nand look for solutions that give each person a favorable part of the solution to resolve the conflict \nAgree and communicate on the best solution and discuss how each person will give and take to come \nup with a solution that is best for the community at large\nAgain community engagement is a powerful way to influence the direction of your career in a  positive \nway especially if you are prepared with some of the skills we have taught you in this bookBecome a Team Player by Embracing Communities 106\nInterview\nEdwin Derks\nQ Welcome Edwin Derks who is a Java Champion One of the most impactful things in his career \nwas becoming a Java Champion\nEdwin tell us a little bit about yourself in terms of where you work and your career journey\nA I am a consultant at Team Rockstars IT in the Netherlands  its a consulting company of about \n500 people  and I have a Java developer background\nI started professionally developing in 2007 but over the years I have grown all the way from Java \ndeveloper to architect and now I work more as a consultant because with every step I tend to find \nout that Im more of a problem solver and a manager than a developer per se but this technical \npackage that I have is really useful for finding the right solutions to the big problems companies have \nin IT Im making myself useful with consulting mostly but also inspiring and coaching colleagues \nto become experts in their field\nQ Very exciting Thats quite a career journey youve had Can you tell us about a moment when your \ncareer started to accelerate and advance\nA The first one was the moment I started to do open source development\nUp until I started to go to conferences and talk to people about open source development I thought \nOK Im a developer I need to develop and get knowledge but mainly develop  I had heard about \nopen source development but never thought it was something for me but then I was convinced by \nsomeone that I still have a lot of contact with today  Emily Jiang from the MicroProfile community She \nsaid OK Edwin you have to own this because you can do this and that  I said OK I will try that \nIve now met so many new people that Ive learned from not only around me in the Netherlands \nbut also from all over the world Ive gained so much new knowledge just by joining an open source \nproject Its really really valuable Open source is not just about development  its about a community \nthat you can learn from and inspire and thats really the thing for me\nThat thing ultimately saw me included among the Java Champions because apparently I had something \nto share with people Now I am a Java Champion which gives me more leverage and a label to also \ninspire other people to do this stuff Being an advocate of open source I think this is not only important \nfor ones own selfeducation but also for people around you and thats what being part of a thriving \ncommunity with these people is all about\nQ Definitely What were some of your early contributions Y ou say you joined the community and \nstarted contributing to open source What were some of the first things that you did when you joined \nTell us about some of your first contributions Did you change the whole projectInterview\n 107\nA A lot of people want to contribute to open source They think I need to contribute I need to be \namazing I need to be able to change the whole project Otherwise I have nothing to contribute  That \nwas the perception that I had\nI just started by joining mailing lists and seeing what was there I started joining meetings to be able \nto hear what people were talking about and then slowly but surely I got into some pull requests \nfor documentation and a little bit of code participating in the process of releasing stuff Gradually \nunderstanding what was going to be needed or done in a certain community gave me the confidence \nthat I needed I was not leaping too far but instead going with the flow trying to find my place there\nEverybody can contribute even if it is just giving your opinion on something If you are using a \ntechnology and its a resource you have the ability to shape the future of the technology because you \nhave a voice If you dont use your voice youre not going to get the feature that you might want in \nthat technology Its a safe environment to just ask for what you want If you cannot make the feature \nyourself maybe other people will develop it for you But maybe you want to contribute Oh I have \njust built this feature Do you want it If its a good feature it gets accepted and you have provided \nsomething yourself\nY ou can do all kinds of stuff Its not just that you need to provide code just being there is valuable\nQ Also as youre in the community youre building trust and becoming known increasing the chances \nthat when you have something to contribute its going to be accepted Y ou talked about becoming a \nJava Champion  how has being a Java Champion impacted your career\nA Being a Java Champion you get a label and then you can do stuff with it Y ou can also decide not to \ndo stuff with it It is a label that you can use to inspire others and to grow yourself so that people really \nrecognize you and say Y ou are now one of the recognized people because you bring something good \nto our community  That is how I like to use my Java Champion label to inspire others to overcome \nhurdles such as thinking theyre not worthy Y ou have something to contribute Y ou become a champion \njust by doing the right thing even if you are not a Java Champion Being about to tell people that I \nam proud of them that they are doing things that I think are good makes me proud myself Thats \nwhat makes me valuable as a Java Champion inspiring others\nQ It is a great accomplishment that you have become a Java Champion\nOne interesting thing that you said in your story is that Java Champion is a label How do you think \nyou became a Java Champion and how can other people do the same\nA Everybody has their own story and no Java Champion is the same Not every Java Champion \nknows everything about Java We all have our thing\nI have my thing with my years of experience in the Java EEJakarta EEMicroProfile development \necosystem because Im consistently advocating for people to use the technology for certain purposes Become a Team Player by Embracing Communities 108\nand be persistently visible on the mailing list in sessions and in meetings Just be there participating \ntrying to help others out evolving certain technologies and building a community Everything comes \ndown to persistence Make sure that youre seen and that you provide something and then everything \nwill figure itself out\nQ This leads a little bit into mentoring Y ou talk about what youve enjoyed about being a Java \nChampion and how having that distinction and honor is inspiring to other people that is like \nmentoring them in a certain way Are there any examples that you want to share of where youve been \nable to influence others\nA I am glad you asked\nI have a company that wants to find new staff to grow and also do our projects Our company is \nalso a culture and a community There have been several times that I have been asked by a recruiter \nCan you participate in this conversation The person in question is a Java developer but they want \nto know more about Java and you are the Java Champion Can you help inspire this Coming into \nthese conversations and being a champion sometimes people look up to you But when I get into a \nconversation and the level goes back to where we are both people and I have a lot of experience that \nI want to share we have beautiful conversations where someone who wants to grow in their career \nlooks up to me and asks Can you help me I say Y es Certainly I want to  if possible  mentor \nyou and give you directions on how you can become the best of yourself \nThose are the moments when I can really use my Java Champion status to do inspirational stuff\nQ Y ou touched on how its not just the mentee but also the mentor who gets something out of it Y ou \nin the mentor role are also getting something out of it It can even be like peertopeer coaching\nmentoring There isnt just one type of mentoring The mentoring experience can benefit anyone in \ntheir career\nA Thats an example\nAs a mentor I dont know everything I have learned from mentoring people because everybody is \ndifferent I learn every day just by being in the community being around people and learning from them\nQ Bazlur has a question\nWe all enjoy working all the time because we tend to do things that we love Thats a hallmark of a \nsoftware developer because we are able to work on things that we love to work on But how do you \nfind balance between work and life\nA Sometimes I really ask myself How do I do all this stuff Because I also have a wife and three \nlittle kids at home and sometimes they have to do without me for a weekSummary\n 109\nFinding balance is about giving and taking within the environment that you have I have a really good \nunderstanding with my wife about what I can do and cannot do and with my employer about what \nI can do and cannot do Within these limits I just do whatever I think is good because work is my \nhobby and my hobby is my work\nSo I just like doing what I do on a daily basis and if I can make that work within the boundaries that \nI have it turns out to be the right thing Y ou need to find balance with the people in your life\nQ Y ou said it was very important for you to mentor other people Have you ever been mentored \nby others\nA Im glad you asked\nI have been inspired by other people and not only by people from the community I have a wife who \nbelieves in me I have a manager who believes in me and who pushes me to conferences all the time \nbecause he believes in me I also look up to people in the community and try to learn from them Im \nnot the center of the universe I learn from other people as well\nIm really grateful for the people that I learned from and that shared their experience and feedback with \nme Im glad to hear that Im doing things wrong because I can then fix things and thats not always \na given  its a gift that you receive Sometimes its a little bit of a scary situation to give feedback to \npeople that are not doing well but sometimes it is the right thing to do to tell someone Hey maybe \nyou should do this instead of that  I hope it turns out to be the right thing  Feedback inspiration \nit all comes together in the right balance\nSummary\nIn this chapter we have helped you to understand the need for community in technical careers \nidentify the type of community to become involved with related to your interests how to participate \nand contribute to communities and increase internal visibility and results through communities \nhow communities can help you grow and how to participate in communities to not only grow but \nimprove your network\nY ou have learned how to build communities of your own and how you can lead communities wherever \nthey may be  internal external virtual or in person\nNow we will focus on another aspect of critical importance for your career growth To advance your \ntechnical career you will also need to spend time giving and receiving mentoring Mentoring is the \ntopic of the next chapter7\nFocus Y our Growth by Giving \nand Receiving Mentoring\nOnce you are part of a community the value of helping others and of being helped becomes clear We \ncannot become our best alone Giving and receiving mentoring is an awesome way to connect more \ndeeply with peers This chapter will show you how to do it\nIn this chapter we will explain a couple of concepts vital to understanding the role mentoring has \nin your career These concepts are that it takes a village to build a developer and mentoring is not a \noneway street Y ou will also learn how to be selective and intentional in your mentoring relationships \nhow to find a mentor and how to be a good mentor\nThe main topics of this chapter are the following\n It takes a village to build a developer\n Mentoring is not a oneway street\n Being selective and intentional\n Finding a good mentor\n Being a good mentor\nBy the end of the chapter you will understand the need for mentorship and peer coaching be able \nto identify the types of mentors and coaches and know what is needed in mentor relationships to \ngive and get how to be intentional in interactions with mentors how to find mentors and how to \nmentor other people\nIt takes a village to make a developer since software development is a soft skill that you practice by doing \nand you do it better when you do it with others who are better than you Software development is not \nonly about training and learning although those things are important  it is also about experience \nDevelopers usually learn on the job That is not ideal because mistakes are costly Mentoring can help \nfill this gapFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 112\nRemember software development is a soft skill As we said earlier soft skills are skills that need to \nbe practiced in real life Software development needs to be practiced by doing software development \nAnd as we talked about before software development is a team activity that is better done with other \ndevelopers An important corollary of that is that software development is not only better when \npracticed together but also when learned together with other people specifically with other developers \nY ou learn and practice soft skills better when you are working together with people that know more \nthan you or are better than you\nY ou become better at software development by practicing with other developers as part of a team When \nyou practice and learn with other developers you will learn from them because you work together \nto collectively improve your software development skills and your communication teamwork and \ncollaboration abilities Many developers you work with will know more than you or be better than \nyou and that is a good thing This provides an even greater opportunity for you to improve your skills\nSome learning and practicing can be done through training That is why the training industry around \nsoftware development is so big and powerful Training is important to learn new skills and new \ntechnologies and to simply get started But to really dive deep into software development there is no \nsubstitute for reallife work That is why most developers learn on the job working on real projects \nin a real team\nA big challenge of onthejob learning is the risk Mistakes are too costly for the company the project \nand the team Worst of all they are especially costly for the individual When you make mistakes \nyou can damage your reputation feel incompetent and even feel like an imposter Mentoring can fill \nthis gap between improving through training and growing through reallife experience on the job \nBuilding relationships with mentors can supplement your learning and add to your village on your \njourney to becoming a better developer\nDifferent types of mentoring\nThere are many  types of mentoring from sporadic advice and QA sessions to a more handson daily \napproach But they all center around the mentor being part of the mentee experience be it by listening \nand understanding the situation and provoking thought and mentality changes providing advice and \nguidance helping with course correction or helping with avoidance and recovery from mistakes\nIn mentoring we learn from each other Whether it is peer to peer pair programming community \nactivities or formal mentoring we learn by working together Mentoring gives us access to people \nthat have more knowledge or experience and can give us the information training and skills that \nwe need to succeed\nMaking the decision to work with a mentor gives you a chance to create relationships with other \ndevelopers that can help you or may need your help Mentoring builds friendships connections and \ncommunities Mentoring is also the best way to transfer experience from you as a more experienced \ndeveloper to less experienced ones Mentors bring their expertise and share their knowledge their \nsuccesses and their failures A mentor helps you to achieve results faster and to fail lessMentoring is not a oneway street\n 113\nNot only will mentors help you achieve results with fewer failures but mentors will also help you see \nclearly They can point out situations identify problems and foresee difficulties With their questions \nand advice mentors can help you get the clarity that you need to advance and acquire the right skills\nMentors help you avoid risky pitfalls so you can learn with a lower risk of damaging your career \nMistakes are indeed part of skill acquisition it is expected that you make mistakes to become better \nBut when you make mistakes that are too damaging they can delay improvements Mentors help you \navoid those risky mistakes\nMentors also improve your networking and help you be part of something Mentors that are already \nconnected and involved with other developers communities and companies can make their network \navailable to mentees increasing the effectiveness of networking and reducing the time it takes for \nyou to get results\nWorking with your mentor will allow you to meet other developers especially more experienced \ndevelopers helping you acquire skills faster A mentor may also help you reach out to less experienced \ndevelopers so you can also be a mentor to other people Mentoring other people also helps you \nto improve your own skills The more you teach and explain the more you understand your own \nexperience Oftentimes a more junior developer can help you to see things in a different way and \nexpand your own understanding of the current environment\nMentoring is not a oneway street\nSince mentoring is so  important we may imagine that as developers we need to be mentored Often \nwe forget that we can also mentor The relationship formed between mentee and mentor can be an \namazing one When you do things with your mentor it will form a stronger bond in your relationship  \nY ou can plan personal or virtual events with your mentor  take a walk or have a walking meeting \nhave a coffee enjoy a meal together or watch a movie together\nWhen searching for a mentor it is easy to imagine that they will help us but mentorship is a twoway \nstreet A reality of career evolution is that helping others helps you too When your mentor is working \nwith you and helping you advance you are helping your mentor improve their own skills Mentoring \nis a required skill for leadership Because of the mutual benefits the relationship between mentor and \nmentee can become strong and fruitful\nFriends have fun together but that is only part of a friendship Friends are people that do meaningful \nthings together When you work with your mentor to advance your career and skills you are doing \nmeaningful work together That creates a strong bond in your relationship\nSo what are some of the benefits of mentoring for you There are two sets of benefits that we must \nconsider the benefits of being a mentee and of becoming a mentor As a mentee you have access to \nexpertise Being able to access expertise from people that have done what you want to do accelerates \nyour results and you make fewer mistakes in achieving your results Here are some more benefits \nof mentoringFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 114\n Access to private information  Working  with a mentor will give you access to information that \nis not easy to come by from stories of success and failures to behindthescenes knowledge of \nhow things happen and even personal insights and tricks Those are not usually published or \neasy to come by from others\n Access to people and networks  Having a good network of peers is fundamental to our career \nIt improves our knowledge and reputation and gives us access to opportunities Because a \nmentormentee relationship becomes one of trust a mentor can help you by introducing you \nto people but also recommending and vouching for you Imagine having access to people that \nyou would not easily have access to and having privileged access from the start\n Opportunities  The best opportunities in the job market are offered to those people that we \ntrust and who have a great reputation When we build a relationship with our mentor that is \na relationship that is built on trust Y our mentor can help you get opportunities that you may \noriginally not have access to because of the trust bond that exists between you\nWith all of that it is easy to think that mentorship is something where the mentor makes all of the \neffort but that is not true Mentoring is not a oneway street When working with your mentor you \nalso help your mentor grow One of the best ways to improve is to apply your experience to different \nsituations And by asking questions discussing different experiences and having a distinct perspective \nyou also help your mentor think about different situations that they have not had previous experience \nwith Y our mentor will grow by helping you overcome obstacles and by having to delve deep into \ntheir own knowledge to help you with yours Also being a mentor will help you with skills such as \nleadership communication empathy and listening Many people start mentoring others to grow in \nthose skills also\nWith that here are a couple of the benefits of being a mentor that you should consider\n Helping people  Every time you  help people you grow Y ou understand your own skills and \nidentify your limitations Facing your own issues so you can help others face their issues is a \nfantastic way to improve specific skills\n Reputation  When people that you are helping grow and succeed your reputation in the market \nalso grows Y ou build trust in your industry\nNow that you understand some of the benefits for mentors and mentees lets discuss how to decide \non the right mentor relationships for you\nBe selective and intentional\nAlthough mentoring is a great tool for improvement and growth it is not only a feelgood activity \nwhere you do it because it is fun and you will feel great about it although it can be a lot of fun at times \nMentoring is challenging work for both sides and it requires a big effort in time and commitment \nY ou should use it to improve in specific areasHow to select a mentor\n 115\nIt is easy to consider mentoring as just a conversation or to build a relationship with your mentor \nand confuse it with friendship but being mentored is hard A good mentor will push your limits so \nyou can succeed faster and grow further That is stressful and often your mentor will possibly end \nup annoying you with tough questions and criticism making you see the truth that you are trying to \nignore or hide even from yourself\nA good mentor will push you to do things you are not comfortable with  things that are outside of \nyour comfort zone One of the hardest parts of mentorship is when it forces you to deal with your \nfailures It is not comfortable to be reminded that you failed or to confront the reasons why that \nhappened It can be especially hard because most times you fail because of your own issues such as \nprocrastination lack of focus lack of attention carelessness and other internal reasons Y ou may want \nto blame others the circumstances and things outside of your control Y our mentor will challenge \nthat and force you to confront your own shortcomings\nThis will help you grow where you need most but that is not easy Invariably it will create some level of \nattrition between you and your mentor that you both will have to navigate and that is not comfortable \neither That is why it is so important to search for a mentor that you trust that can guide and inspire \nyou to be on track even when things are hard and uncomfortable\nAnd because attrition will happen your mentor needs to be empathetic to your situation Many times \na mentor may be judgmental or point bluntly at your mistakes and difficulties That may cause hard \nfeelings and make your progress slower A strong trust in your mentor will help you overcome even \nthose obstacles\nBeing honest open and direct with your mentor will help you both to achieve a level of understanding \nand comprehension and working together will help you both in communication and growth That is \none reason why when you are looking for a mentor you should be selective and try to find one that \nyou can have good conversations with and with whom you have mutual trust Look for a mentor that \nyou can trust to be really interested in the positive attributes and skills you have to offer Once you \nhave selected a mentor make yourself available to your mentor and be willing to not only receive \nadvice from your mentor but also to help your mentor with their work and initiatives when possible\nHow to select a mentor\nWrite out your goals for your career and make sure they are SMARTER This will help you to understand \nwhere you have gaps in achieving your goals and help you to see where you could use mentorship \nSome examples are to develop new skills expand your network in a specific industry sector or build \nconfidence to have some difficult conversations Once your goals are outlined and you have identified \nyour gaps think about how a mentor could help you to achieve your goals Create a specific plan or \ndescription of how they could help you whether it is working on a certain project introducing you to \ntheir network or coaching you on how to have a particular conversation that is hindering your success \nNext you can start to search your network  Consider people you have met at events or conferences \nthrough current or previous roles from your academic career or even seconddegree connections Focus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 116\nLook for someone who fits the description or has the skills you are looking for to achieve your goals \nOftentimes people think that you need to find someone who is exactly like you to be a mentor This \ncan be comfortable and often it is a good match however you can learn from and be challenged \nmore by people who are different from you whether that is in gender race cultural background or \nanything else Look for a way to create diversity in your network This will help you to grow in your \ncareer and embrace different points of view\nFinding a good mentor\nMentors can be  found in many places among your friends work colleagues people in the industry \nteachers and many more possibilities There are the steps to finding a good mentor\n Be clear on what you want to accomplish\n Look for someone that has done what you are trying to do\n Look for someone that you trust or admire\n Look for someone that is willing to build a relationship with you\nLets look at these steps in detail\nStep 1  be clear on what you want to accomplish\nBecause mentorship is better if you are trying to grow or improve a specific situation it is important \nthat you are incredibly clear about what you want to accomplish Finding a mentor that will help you \nachieve what you want will make the entire process a lot more interesting for you both Go after your \nbig dreams and find a mentor that will help you accomplish a specific thing that you want and create \nthe motivation for you to face the challenges and difficulties around mentorship Be clear about your \nmain goals and search for a mentor that can help you achieve those\nStep 2  look for someone that has done what you are trying to do\nThere is a substantial difference between mentoring and coaching A coach will help you think about \nyour own problems and figure out your own solutions A mentor however will bring their experiences \nto guide you toward your goals and because of that it is better that you work with a mentor that has \ndone what you are trying to do That way your mentor will help you achieve what you really want \nbased on firsthand experiences Notice that a mentor does not have to have achieved exactly your \ndream The mentor should have experience  and results in similar skills areas and achievements to \nthe ones you are aiming for\nStep 3  look for someone that you trust or admire\nMentoring is demanding work Y ou will clash with your mentor multiple times because you are \ntrying to overcome your own failures and limitations and your mentor will be pushing you to do it \nIt will be easier if you trust your mentor and if you have some level of admiration If not you will be \nquestioning all the time whether your mentor can really help you or not or whether your mentor is Finding a good mentor\n 117\nreally the person that is right for you If this is the case then you will not do what needs to be done \nso it is better to search for another mentor\nStep 4  look for someone that is willing to build a relationship with you\nMentorships are all about relationships A mentor that is not willing to work with you will not help \nyou It goes both ways Look for someone that you are willing to have a relationship with As an \nexample if your mentor is someone that goes to places that you dont want to go deals with people \nthat you dont want to deal with or does things that you dont want to be part of there is a big chance \nthat youre not going to be able to build a relationship with that mentor\nOnce you have found what you are looking for in a mentor it is time to make the ask From our \nexperience this is often one of the most uncomfortable parts of mentoring relationships It can be \nawkward It can be especially challenging to find the courage to be vulnerable and ask the question \nWe offer two approaches for you to consider at that moment\n Let it grow organically\nOur advice for this approach is to start small with little commitment  send a short email asking \nfor a brief meeting and take time getting to know a little bit more about them to see whether \nyou think they are a good fit Ask if you can get their advice on a situation or challenge and \nthen express your appreciation for their time Ask if you can follow up with them again in a \nspecified amount of time and thank them for their willingness to meet with you Follow up for \nanother meeting and keep it simple with a followup based on your last conversation If they \nagree to meet with you again suggest that you would like to expand on your conversation from \nyour last meeting and then suggest another topic you would like to discuss with them This can \nbecome a segue into a more longterm relationship Heather has used this approach successfully \nin the past to initiate a mentoring relationship in a more informal mentorship process\n The direct approach\nThere are also times when you want a more formal relationship and commitment Keep in mind \nthat this is more responsibility for you and your potential mentor Y ou should also take the \ntime to get to know your prospective mentor in this situation and be prepared to listen more \nthan you speak to get to know more about them If you feel it is a good fit and you are ready \nto dedicate the time that will be required for a productive mentor relationship ask simply and \nsincerely whether they are willing to mentor you for a specified amount of time Share with \nthem and express your appreciation for their expertise and be specific about what you are \nlooking to achieve and how you think they can help you achieve it Heather has found that six \nmonths is an ideal amount of time for most desired outcomes Once you achieve the goals you \nspecified in advance you can then follow on with another goal or continue with your mentor \nrelationship if both parties desire Express your thanks and appreciation for their consideration \nwhether they accept or decline Be mindful that formal mentorship is a big  time commitment \nthat not everyone will be willing to invest time in developingFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 118\n Use SMART goals\nSpecific\nFully describe in concrete language the desired  outcome Describe what is to be accomplished\nMeasurable\nMake sure your goal is quantifiable or measurable in some way Describe how you will know \nyouve achieved your objective\nAttainable\nCreate stretch yet achievable goals To assess attainability have a conversation about practicality \nas well as the resources and support needed\nRelevant\nRelevant to your groups objectives and mission\nTimebound\nWhat is the time frame for achieving the goal\nAnswer the question  By when will I achieve the desired end result  Note large goals may \ninclude milestone dates\nBeing intentional\nMentoring should  help you grow in a specific area and direction It is not a catchall activity It is \nimportant to be clear on why you are looking for a mentor Here are a few ideas for you to consider \nand build clarity on\n Achieve a goal or dream that you have  Many times we have great dreams that we might \nthink are impossible that will take too long or that we do not see a way to achieve A mentor \ncan accelerate or shortcut your path to achieving those dreams Search for a mentor that has \nachieved similar things to what you dream about and that has dreams that align with yours Look \nfor a mentor that has skills you admire or has accomplished something you want to achieve\n Be recognized as someone that you aspire to be  A mentor can also help you become and \nbe recognized as someone that you want to be such as an expert in your field Be clear with \nyourself about who you want to become That could be a specific position or gaining recognition \nin the market Recognition is one of the most important things for our careers and a mentor \ncan help you to be recognized for the things that you have done by the people it is important \nto be recognized by\n Improve or acquire skills  A mentor can also help you improve or acquire one or more skills \nthat you know you need Helping you accelerate the acquisition of skills is one of the best results \nthat a mentor can bring to your career Skill acquisition especially soft skills is not only arduous \nwork but if done alone it becomes even harder Working with someone that has the skill and \nthat can point you to the right path can help you advance faster Look for mentors that have the Finding a good mentor\n 119\nskills you need and dream of having As we talked about in other chapters skills require doing \nso your mentor should have done it and mastered the skill or have close contact with people \nthat have mastered it so they can help you do the same Look for mentors that are recognized \nfor the skills you want and need to improve\n Overcome obstacles  One of the most critical areas a mentor can help you with is overcoming \nobstacles or limits that you have been dealing with It is extremely easy in our careers to reach \na wall  a place or situation where you believe you cannot go further Although those hardto\nconquer obstacles offer exciting potential for growth they are very frustrating and can lead to \nyou giving up and believing it is not possible especially when you do not know why you cannot \novercome the obstacle A mentor may have faced similar obstacles in the past and overcome \nthem That way you can understand what is really preventing you from doing the same\n Identify limits  Mentors can also identify limits that we do not see They can guide us to skills \nknowledge and people that we might not even know exist They enable you to do things that you \nthought were impossible and help with your understanding of markets and situations On our \npath to growth it is normal to not know where we are going Y ou do not know the environment \nthe landscape or the people Because of that you imagine that some things are impossible or \nyou believe you need to take long routes to get to your desired destination Often this is just a \nmisunderstanding of reality because you have never experienced it And that builds a mentality \ntrap where you cannot fathom what is possible Because your mentor has experienced that \nsituation they understand what is going on and can help you see the real path\nOnce you are working  with a mentor be intentional and make the best of it Next we will give you a \nfew tips and tricks for you and your mentor to get the best results and enjoy the process\nCreate a plan\nWhen Heather was  mentoring a junior developer at Andela in Nigeria she used a document template \nthey had created to guide their discussions It was a simple Word table document that contained the \ngoals and skills to focus on in the mentoring relationship Heather found this kept their conversations \nfocused on the end results and the purpose of their interactions This is a best practice for intentional \nmentorship Create a document outlining what you will accomplish in your mentoring relationship \n use it as a working document each time that you meet It will help add clarity for you and for your \nmentor by helping share the goal of the relationship and being accountable for the results It can also \nguide you to create an agenda for each meeting Y ou can share your goals and milestones and be \naccountable going prepared for your conversations This document will also be useful in helping you \nto measure progress toward your mentorship goals And always send a thankyou note after every \nmeeting to express your appreciation and capture any action itemsFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 120\nGo deep into discussions\nGo deep into  discussions so you really understand how your mentor thinks and makes decisions Y ou \ncan mimic what your mentor does and apply it to your life as fast as possible bring back results and \nfailures to discuss and then apply the advice again and fix and adjust things to build a feedback loop\nGoing deep will allow you to really understand how your mentor thinks and makes decisions  this \nhelps you to develop skills such as empathy and emotional intelligence Knowledge can be easily \nacquired through books and tutorials but the way other people think is extremely hard to learn \nMentorship works best in that situation\nPaying close attention to how your mentor thinks and understanding the reasons behind your \nmentors decisions suggestions and ideas will help you think like your mentor We call those mental \nrepresentations  the way your mentor sees the world and represents the things in their mind is what \nmakes them who they are Understanding how your mentor thinks and the mental representations they \nhave helps you build your own mental representations and eventually make decisions like your mentor\nMimic what your mentor does so you can do the same Have you ever heard the expression  Fake it \nto make it  or another incarnation  Fake it till you become it  If you do the things that your mentor \ndoes it will help you become like your mentor Pay close attention to the things your mentor does \nwith you and with other mentees or for themselves and in their own career As much as possible \nmimic what they are doing in your career\nApply lessons in your life as fast as possible\nMentorship will  help you grow faster but for that you have to apply things as fast as possible When \nyour mentor suggests something to you try to experiment with it as soon as possible Apply the \nsuggestions in small situations as an experiment in side projects and apply them to other parts of \nyour life The sooner you experiment with something the sooner you are going to have something to \ndiscuss with your mentor This will help you to develop more truth in your relationship For a mentor \nit is frustrating to repeat the same thing repeatedly for lengthy periods of time without any response \nfrom the mentee No matter whether it is done correctly or not trying things out will give you results \nand make the mentoring more valuable and interesting for both of you\nBring back results\nIt is important to bring back results or failures to discuss with your mentor Once you apply things \nyoull make mistakes and youll have good and bad results Bring results back to your mentor so you \ncan discuss them together and see why the failure or success happened Create open communication \nand dialogue in this process Y our mentor will be incredibly pleased to hear about your successful \nresults but they will be even more interested in learning how you tried to apply things and how that \nfailed to work That discussion can be very fruitful for you both By figuring out ways to overcome \nobstacles created in your situation you help your mentorBe the best mentee for your mentor\n 121\nReply and try again once you get some feedback reapply it fix what you tried try again and adjust \nwhat you did Then bring your results back again This is how results are achieved\nBe the best mentee for your mentor\nA good mentee will  pay close attention and will work on the things that need to be worked on A \ngood mentee will do things to get closer to the mentor and will want to do things with the mentor \nas much as possible of course Y ou want to be appropriate and respectful not overly demanding of \nyour mentor Strive to be the best mentee to your mentor by doing the things suggested applying the \nthings you need to apply and asking questions Also be helpful to your mentor Help your mentor \nachieve things they want and work on their projects as well The closer the relationship that you build \nwith your mentor the more results you are going to have in your own life And once your mentorship \narrangement comes to a close you should continue to say thanks every so often when you think of \nthem This goes both ways  when you have given and received mentorship sending a note of thanks \nand appreciation can deepen the trust and connection in your relationship and recall memories of \nyour time together\nBeing a good mentor  you can mentor people too\nNow that you know how to be mentored and once you have gained some experience in this process \nand built a mentor relationship think about how you could mentor other people There are some \nguidelines to keep in mind when you are ready to start mentoring people\nHere are five things to consider while mentoring people\n Build experience mentors do best when they have done it\n Be one step ahead of your mentees\n Listen listen listen\n Mentors are not coaches help direct their efforts\n Mentors are not teachers help them do it in real life\nMentoring is not only great for the mentee It is also helpful for the mentor When you teach you better \nunderstand what you are teaching and that helps you deepen your knowledge of the things that you \nare good at When you mentor others you are trying to help them do what you have already done It \nmotivates you to keep growing toward your own goals A mentor also strives to be one step ahead of \ntheir mentees which will push them to try things out and gain experience in things that they intend \nto do Finally when you mentor people you become a trusted advisor\nThat is a great position to be in It creates recognition not only for your mentees but for everyone \naround you When people see you helping others to achieve success they recognize you as a leader \nand as someone that has experience and is successful Since mentoring is such a powerful thing for \nyour own career too let us look at the preceding list in more detailFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 122\nStep one  build experience\nMentors do best when they help people achieve things that they have done themselves Although it \nis not necessary to have done exactly what your mentees want to do having realworld experience in \nsimilar situations is extremely important to help them overcome their obstacles As a good mentor \ntry to implement things in your own career When you learn about new ideas methods and tools \nuseful to your mentees try to experiment with them Work them into your life and career See if you \ncan get tangible results Because of your experience you may be able to get results faster than your \nmentees would or figure out shortcuts that can help them\nNot only will you grow and advance yourself but you will be able to guide your mentees toward \nimplementing the same ideas and tools in their careers That is especially important for skills The \ntwo most important things as a mentor are to help your mentees with mindset  and skill sets Work \non building new skills yourself Experiment with new ways to apply your existing skills Overcome \nyour own difficulties in building new skills All of these will help you and your career by helping you \nimprove your current skill set and will also make you a better guide for your mentees\nStep two  try to be one step ahead of your mentees\nWhen mentoring people your experience will help you see ahead of time the obstacles difficulties \nand necessities that they are soon going to face Y ou can then be ready to be one step ahead of them \nWhen you see they will need a skill that you do not have yet build it for yourself When you realize \nthey are going to need tools or experience or an example you can find the tools create some real\nworld experience for yourself and use that as an example of what is possible\nApply the tools or experience and be ready to help your mentees when they arrive at the problem \nBeing one step ahead will not only help your mentees to achieve results faster but it will help you to \nkeep growing An effective way to be one step ahead of your mentees is to have a mentor yourself \nWorking with people even more experienced than you can help you understand grow and be ready \nto help your mentees when they need it Y ou can also apply the lessons you learn from your mentors \nand translate them to your mentees at the exact stage they are in their careers\nStep three  listen listen listen\nIt is amazingly easy to believe that as a mentor it is your job to solve all the problems or to tell people \nwhat to do all the time That is not the case As a mentor you need to understand your mentees \nproblems and help them think like you so they can solve their problems in a comparable way to how \nyou would solve them This mindset change you will provoke in your mentees will help them think at \nthe same level as someone more experienced so they can solve problems better and better This can \nhave a profound impact on your mentees lives\nThe best way to do this is to listen and not speak Listen to what they are going through Listen to how \nthey are thinking about things Listen to what challenges they are facing Listen to what solutions they \nare proposing That way when you offer advice or guidance you can start from their perspective and \nfrom the specific situation your mentees are going through at that time To be an amazing mentor Being a good mentor  you can mentor people too\n 123\npractice listening and ask questions Try to understand exactly what is going on Dig deep into how \nyour mentees are thinking about the situation Producing a suggestion or some advice too early may \nnegatively impact your mentees ability to think for themselves and to learn to think as you do\nStep four  mentors are not coaches  help direct them\nWhen we mention the importance of listening it is easy to go all the way to the opposite side and \nbelieve that you are not supposed to offer any advice That is for instance how a coach operates A \ncoach is someone that helps people to solve their own problems by themselves Coaches are encouraged \nto never give their opinion so people can come to their own conclusions and own solutions\nThat is why a coach can be helpful even when they do not have experience A coach helps their \ncoachees use their own experience to solve situations This is all good and fine  there is a place for \ncoaches and sometimes you can even use this strategy with your mentees Again mentors are not \ncoaches Mentors have experience in the goals you are trying to achieve They have done it Y ou have \ndone what your mentees want to do Because you have the experience you know the path Y ou see \nthe challenges Y ou know people that can help Y ou know the tricks and the pitfalls And if all of those \nthings can help your mentee to solve challenges faster and better you should guide them\nGuide your mentees to their desired outcome so they can achieve the things that they want to achieve \nby using your experience That does not mean forcing something upon them it means listening to \ntheir current situation and giving advice based on your stories and your results Y ou can tell stories \nY ou can ask questions Y ou can suggest experiments Y ou can introduce people or point them to \nresources There are many ways to guide your mentees to their outcomes without forcing them But \nat the same time participate actively in their success\nStep five  mentors are not instructors  help them do it in real life\nAnother common pitfall for mentors is to believe that they are instructors  that their job is to teach the \nmentee how to do things The mentor helps with the mentees mentality and skills And those things \nonly work if you help your mentee to apply things in real life Instead of considering mentorship as a \nmoment to instruct people use your mentorship time to evaluate what has been tried and to analyze \nthe obstacles the problems and the difficulties so you can help your mentee take one more step or try \none more thing Y ou should help them move closer to their goal and that will only happen if they do \nit themselves Work with your mentees to get them to act and apply things to their lives and careers \nUse your examples and experience to motivate them to take concrete steps\nConsidering all those five steps mentorship is about helping your mentee to act so they can achieve \nresults and success in things and skills that you have had similar experiences with in the past Use \nyour experience your life stories challenges and the difficulties that you have had in the past to help \nyour mentees reevaluate how they think and take action about their own problems and difficulties \nHelp them implement a plan that will take them where they want to be Along the way while you \nare helping them use mentoring to help  you move forward in your own goals and results The best \nmentors are the ones that keep growing and evolving and keep achieving even better stronger results \nin their own careers When you grow you can help your mentees to do the sameFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 124\nWe would like to share with you the experience of Elder Moraes working at Red Hat as an example\nInterview\nElder Moraes\nQ Can you tell us where you work now\nA Currently I work at Red Hat having moved there from Oracle in early 2020 at the beginning of \nthe pandemic My role at Red Hat involves leading the Red Hat developers for Latin America where \nI work with the Latin community delivering Spanish content and talks\nQ Do you speak Spanish\nA Y es I do When I was interviewed for my current role my boss asked me if I could speak Spanish \nand I had to learn It was not too difficult as Spanish is a close language to Portuguese which is my \nnative language\nQ How did you first get involved with the Java community\nA In around 2015 I discovered a group in Brazil that was discussing Java on IRC called SouJava \nI contacted the group and a year later I was working with Bruno Souza when he asked me to help \npromote the release of Java EE 8 We ended up conducting a series of interviews with prominent \nfigures in the Java community which brought me to author a book about Java EE SouJavas initial \nrecognition of my initiative set me on a path that led to my current role I passionately believe in \nthe power of community especially in the Java  ecosystem where people are open to new members \nmaking it helpful for ones career\nQ Can you recall your first encounter with Bruno and how did you two meet\nA Oh I cannot remember laughter It has been so long but we kept in touch through phone calls \nand emails for months We had not met in person until a developer conference JavaOne Brazil \nwhere we were scheduled to give a talk together We had never met before so it was like meeting \nan acquaintance for the first time After that talk Bruno and I gave dozens of talks together Every \nexperience we had with the community convinced me of the power of connecting with people who \nshare similar interests and passions\nQ I heard that you have a mentoring program Can you tell us more about it\nA Y es I do have a small mentoring program and it is because I am the result of having a mentor \nmyself who happens to be Bruno I believe in the power of having a mentor because it can save you a Interview\n 125\nlot of time As someone once said a mentor is someone who is just a few steps ahead of you and can \nreach out their hand to guide you When you have a mentor you can avoid making mistakes that they \nhave already made and they can offer advice on what to do and what not to do In my case having \nBruno as my mentor helped me to grow my career significantly faster than if I were doing it alone\nQ What inspired you to start your own mentoring program\nA A few years ago as I started to achieve some results in my career people started coming to me \nwith questions like What should I do next or How can I prepare for an interview I realized that \nI could use my experience to help others who were in the same position that I once was Thats why \nI decided to create a small group where I could mentor people more closely It has been a fun and \nrewarding experience and I am still learning from it\nQ What do you think are the benefits of mentoring both for the mentor and the mentee\nA The benefits of mentoring are numerous As a mentee you can learn from someone who has more \nexperience and knowledge than you which can help you to grow and develop faster than if you were \ndoing it alone As a mentor you can give back to the community by sharing your knowledge and \nexperience Also mentoring can help you to reflect on your own experiences and learn from them \nUltimately both the mentor and the mentee can benefit from the relationship by learning from each other\nQ Can you share some advice for those who want to start mentoring others\nA My advice for those who want to start mentoring others is to be patient and understanding Every \nmentee is different and you need to adapt your mentoring style to their needs Also be open to \nlearning from your mentee because they can offer fresh perspectives and ideas Finally be willing \nto share your experience and knowledge generously as that is the primary purpose of mentoring \nRemember when you are mentoring you always learn something along the way  mentor or mentee \nThat is the point of mentoring\nQ Can you tell us about a success story from your mentoring group\nA Y es there is one guy named Maximilian or Max for short who I am very proud of He had 20 \nyears of experience but felt stuck in his career When he came to me I answered every question he \nhad with advice based on my own experiences As a mentor it is important to share your knowledge \nand get involved with the community Max started to do this and in the two years that we have been \nworking together he has become a developer advocate for a big company in Brazil that is related to \na big bank He never thought he would be able to do this kind of job but by working together and \nbecoming closer he saw that not only was it possible but he also had the skills to do it Seeing people \nachieve their potential through mentoring is amazingFocus Your Growth by Giving and Receiving Mentoring 126\nQ How did you help Max achieve his goals\nA I answered every question Max had with advice based on my own experiences I also encouraged \nhim to get involved with the community lead initiatives and build relationships By doing these things \nMax was able to see the possibilities that were available to him and develop the skills he needed to \nachieve his goals I supported him every step of the way and helped him to believe in himself\nQ What do you think is the most important quality for a mentor to have\nA I think the most important quality for a mentor to have is the ability to listen Y ou need to be able \nto listen to your mentees concerns and questions in order to provide relevant and helpful advice Y ou \nalso need to be patient and supportive and be willing to provide guidance even when its difficult Its \nalso important to be knowledgeable in your field and to be able to share that knowledge with others\nQ How can someone become a mentor\nA To become a mentor you should have expertise and experience in a particular field or industry \nY ou should also be willing to share your knowledge and help others achieve their goals It is important \nto have good communication skills and be able to listen to your mentees concerns and questions \nY ou can start by volunteering to mentor someone in your workplace or community or by joining a \nmentoring program or organization Networking is also important as it can help you connect with \npotential mentees\nQ What advice would you give to someone who is looking for a mentor\nA If you are looking for a mentor start by identifying someone who has expertise and experience in \nyour field or industry Look for someone who is willing to share their knowledge and provide guidance \nY ou should also consider the persons communication skills and whether you  feel comfortable talking \nto them Do not be afraid to reach out to people and ask if they would be willing to mentor you Y ou \ncan also look for mentoring programs or organizations that match mentors with mentees\nSummary\nIn this chapter you learned about the need for mentorship and peer coaching Y ou can now identify \nthe types of mentors and coaches you require what is needed in mentoring relationships giving and \ngetting how to be intentional in your interactions with mentors how to find mentors and how to \nmentor other people\nNext we will discuss how to operate in larger groups and how to interact with people via meetups \nand user group meetings8\nBe Part of a Larger Group  \nMeeting People at User Groups \nand Meetups\nThe power of community participation is not an abstract one where our careers magically start growing \njust because we spend time with people we already know Y ou must actively look for and engage with \npeers and reach out to a larger group That is when the benefits of community participation kick in \nand help you to advance your career This chapter will discuss some of the most vibrant and accessible \ncommunities for you to engage with in your area of interest\nIn the chapter we discuss user group meetings as places where real developers meet We will expand \non how to find a community near you how to make the most of your participation the benefits of \ngetting involved how to deepen your participation and the results you can expect from attending \nuser group meetings\nWell discuss these main topics in the chapter\n Where real developers meet\n Finding a community near you\n Making the most of your participation\n The benefits of getting involved\n Deepening your participation and your results\n Starting your own user group\nBy the end of the chapter you will understand what user groups and meetups are Y ou will be able \nto find a community that you can connect to and join participate in user groups with purpose be \nclear on the objectives of your participation and be able to take action to increase your involvement \ntoward leadership of the groupBe Part of a Larger Group  Meeting People at User Groups and Meetups 128\nWhere real developers meet\nSoftware development especially  in the modern era is a group activity The days of the single developer \nworking alone in their garage are long gone Not only that but as we said in a previous chapter software \ndevelopment is a soft skill That means its much easier for you to learn and improve your software \ndevelopment skills while working with other developers particularly ones that are better than you\nOne aspect related to communities is networking Meeting your peers is an important and frequently \ndiscussed element of career growth We must point out that communities and networking are not the \nsame Networking is the sum of people that you know and interact with\nPeople in your personal and professional networks can come from all kinds of places your family \nfriends and work They may or may not know and interact with each other The commonality they \nhave is their relationship with you\nCommunities on the other hand are centered around common goals and interests That can be \na technology a project a specific objective or even participation in something such as an event \nproject or activity This is also networking in a way but communities are focused on promoting \nrelationships between the participants In your own personal network you probably know people from \nthe multiple communities that you participate in So although not exactly the same thing networking \nand communities go hand in hand\nWith that in mind communities of software developers are places and spaces where developers with \nthings in common meet usually around learning using or improving a shared product or technology \nBeing part of a community like this lets you network with peers that have similar interests and \nobjectives as you\nAs Adam Grants describes in his book Give and Take  networking can give you an edge in your \ncareer Adam explains the research behind having access to a larger network that gives you access to \nknowledge experience and influence Since communities and networking go hand in hand the same \nbenefits are provided and enhanced by being part of a community\nThese are some of the benefits that networking and being part of a community can deliver\n Access to knowledge  As part of a community you have access to confidential  information \nmeaning information that is not easily or publicly accessible such as details about projects \nproblems encountered job opportunities and more that people from the community know \nabout and will share with you because you are part of the group\n Access to diversity of skills  In your community you will come across and be able to benefit \nfrom a diverse set of skills Members have different experiences work on distinct types of \nprojects use a variety of tools and technologies and have gone through unique difficulties \nAll these build skills and expertise Being part of the group and being able to learn all this \ninformation from people and reach out to them when you need help allows you to advance \nyour own skills faster and more easilyWhere real developers meet\n 129\n Influence and power  Each of us has some level of influence in our companies and the projects \nthat we participate in Knowing and having access to people in the industry gives you a little \ninfluence through them As an example when someone from your community knows and \ntrusts you and suggests you let us say for a job that is you having a power that you would \nnot have alone\nAdam Grant mentions  the research that shows that those people who build large networks that is \nparticipate in communities tend to be evaluated more highly in their job performance are promoted \nfaster and end up earning more money than people that dont build their networks This is a result \nof the knowledge experience and influence that you have access to by being part of a community\nKnowing this it is not a surprise that developers that get involved with communities grow their careers \nat a faster pace often to levels that those who do not participate can never achieve\nThat is not to say that community participation is a utilitarian process Those that think they can just \nturn up and enjoy the benefits usually do not This is because it requires trust and that in turn requires \ninvolvement and giving Just wanting to be involved is not enough you need to do it in a way that \nbenefits both the community and your career\nSo lets take a look at what it takes to get involved with communities in a way that will get you growing \nFirst a quick primer on what communities are all about Many developer communities are called \nuser groups  Developers like you may flinch at the word users  but user groups are groups of users \nof a specific technology or product In the case of development technologies such as programming \nlanguages and programming tools the users of those tools are developers Y ou\nTechnology or developmentfocused user groups are groups of developers that use a specific technology \nor product And because we use the same tech product or tool we have similar problems User group \ncommunities then are the place where we can come together discuss problems we are going through \nevaluate solutions and share experiences  in general solve our problems together It is a place be it \nphysical or virtual where we can meet and work with people that are better than us\nIt is also a good place to discuss the future of our technology of choice since an important part of user \ncommunities is the objective of advancing the technology Users of technology are the ones who really \nunderstand where things need to improve and what the difficulties or challenges are that prevent the \ntechnology from being adopted more widely\nPrecisely because of those discussions user communities attract the participation of vendors A smart \nvendor will connect with those communities to figure out how users are benefiting from their products \nhow they can improve things and even how they can increase their sales With this coming together \nof the users and vendors of a technology user communities tend to become extremely important and \nvaluable Not only do they tend to help improve the technology and spread knowledge about its usage \nthey are also pivotal in bringing in new users to the technologyBe Part of a Larger Group  Meeting People at User Groups and Meetups 130\nUser communities are often a place that receives beginners and introduces them to the technology \nin question They provide things such as tutorials stepbystep guides and other beginnerfocused \ncontent This helps bring newcomers up to speed in learning about new technologies\nBeing a port of entry many make the mistake of believing that user communities are composed only of \nbeginners That could not be farther from the truth The people that participate in those communities \ngrow as professionals together The connections and friendships made in those communities often \nlast for years Professionals that build their careers on a technology or product end up growing and \nachieving a large reputation in those networks\nCommunities especially those that have existed for a long time are usually built of a significant \npercentage of professionals that bring benefits to and benefit from relationships and networking \nCommunities are a congregation of beginners experienced professionals and vendors All work \ntogether in one way or another to spread knowledge advance technology bring newcomers up to \nspeed discuss problems and solutions to move forward and analyze difficult problems and solutions \nthat are faced by many\nThere are several ways that a community like this can be organized In the Java world for example \ndevelopers are usually organized around Java User Groups JUGs But almost every technology \nhas its own user groups meetups discussion forums mailing lists online groups Facebook groups \nDiscord servers Slack channels or other forms of organizing and bringing the community together\nAs a developer one  thing that you can do to really grow your career is to get involved with a community \nthat is close to you either physically or in terms of technology Use that to increase your network \nand with that grow your access to knowledge experience and influence\nFinding a community near you\nThere is no doubt that inperson meetings are better for networking When you meet with people \nface to face it is easier to build friendships Y ou have more opportunities to discuss things Y ou have \neven more possibilities for meeting new people\nThat is why the best way to participate delivering greater results to you and to the community is by \ngetting involved with a local community located physically near you That said online meetings are \nclearly more convenient Y ou can participate in online meetings from anywhere without problems of \ntransportation and less time and money needing to be spent Especially with the increase in sophistication \nof online conferencing tools and other remote technologies meeting online has become the preferred \nway of doing things and many communities now provide ways for you to participate fully online\nThe problem with online participation is that its usually harder for you to meet people and have parallel \nconversations which dramatically reduces your opportunities for networking and ends up restricting \nyour participation to that of only a receiver of content In an inperson meeting both before and \nafter the main presentation you have the chance to meet people and have smalltalk Y ou can learn \nabout projects activities and job opportunities in more informal onetoone conversations like thisFinding a community near you\n 131\nOnline meetings however are usually centered around the main presentation and lose a lot of that \nparallel networking That said if you participate in the organization work of the community you will \nprobably have the same level of access to people either online or in person Online communities also \ntry to replicate inperson activities by running online forums Telegram groups Discord servers or \nSlack channels That way members and participants can  have those parallel conversations and meet \npeople even outside the meetings and presentations\nThat brings us to the question of where you could look to find a community either near you physically \nor close to your interests Of course the first place you should look is a search engine A quick search for \nyour location and the name of your chosen technology perhaps also adding the words community  \nuser group  or forum  will usually lead you to someone or something around you if it exists \nAlso consider the following\n Meetupcom  is a good starting point Its more focused on inperson talks and the site has \nlittle support for building the community itself so it is more of a directory where you can find \ninformation about upcoming meetings\n Discord and Slack  are chat platforms for synchronous or asynchronous conversation and are \nuniversally used by developers They allow communities to organize themselves in their own \nspace Searching for either a Discord server or a Slack channel that focuses on the technology \nyoure interested in is an effective way to get involved in a community\n Facebook  also has some strong group features that allow many communities to be formed By \nand large Facebook communities are organized by less technical people and are preferred by \ngroups and communities not related to technology but many developersfocused communities \ndo meet in Facebook groups\n Eventbrite\n Twitter Spaces\n LinkedIn Groups\n Mentoring groups\n Informal or formal groups at your company with colleagues\n Online discussion groups such as Stack Overflow Reddit and Quora\n groupsio  provides mailing list solutions allowing communities to organize themselves using \nemail Y ou can find thousands of different communities here\nDont forget to look at the site of your preferred technology Many of those sites will list communities \nplaces and future meetings that you can participate in Even if you cant find anything near you getting \ninvolved with any of those communities even if only online will give you insights into certain places \nand meetings that you might not easily find information about otherwiseBe Part of a Larger Group  Meeting People at User Groups and Meetups 132\nOne caveat that we have to point out when looking for communities is the fact that most communities \nare organized by volunteers with little time on their hands It is not uncommon that communities \nhave very outdated sites or communication channels If you see a website or a social media account \nthat seems to be inactive or with very old posts that does  not necessarily mean that the community \nitself is not active and no longer meeting We suggest that you reach out to whatever contacts you can \nfind to determine the real situation\nMaking the most of your participation\nWith participation the first level is of course being present even if just to watch and follow the content \nY ou as with most people may start participating in communities because you see valuable content \npresentations articles blog posts or any content that can help you evolve Even on the first level of \njust watching you can derive much greater results if you make a little bit of extra effort\nFirst participate live  as much as possible Even if youre watching a fully online community where \neverything is recorded try to be there live That way you can properly interact with other people with \nthe organizers and speakers of the community and you have the option to ask questions\nSo make a special effort to ask questions  This helps the wider community increasing the interaction \nbetween the speakers and the audience and even between the participants It also helps the organizers \nto see that their efforts are working When you ask questions you help the speaker create content \nspecific to the situation you are experiencing It turns that generic presentation into something that \nreally helps you in your career goals\nAnother effortless way that you can participate even if you are only online is by promoting the event \nand the speaker  Every community strives to grow and that usually happens by word of mouth So the \nmore you promote the events the better its going to be for everyone in the community as a whole\nY ou can do this by sharing future events on your social media and inviting your colleagues from work \nto watch and participate with you Y ou can also take pictures and screenshots of the speaker while \nthey are presenting and share that All of this helps attract a larger audience to the content Even after \nthe presentation is finished you can share the recordings on social media along with the lessons you \nlearned or you could provide that  information directly to your friends and projects All of this helps \nthe community be more visible and draw more people to future activities\nParticipate in person  if you can As we mentioned before inperson participation is much better \nand much more useful for you but it also provides more value to the community too Pictures of an \nauditorium full of people speakers interacting with developers in person many developers visiting \noffices All of these help the community to be seen as more effective and important\nNot only do you win by having better networking opportunities but also in the future the community \nwill attract even more interesting speakers and vendors giveaways and of course larger audiences \nEveryone wins No matter whether online or in person help the group however you can  Promote the \nevents invite friends take pictures offer a meeting place at your company suggest that your company \nsponsors the community and register for paid community events and activities All of these are small Making the most of your participation\n 133\nthings that can be done that increase the value of the community and expand the benefits that the \ncommunity provides to everyone\nY ou should also offer to help When you start helping the community you start moving from just \nparticipating to helping the organizers Organizers get the most value from the community because \nthey have the possibility of stronger deeper interactions with speakers and vendors Organizers have \nmore access to opportunities and have the benefits of networking on a much larger scale Of course \norganizers also put in more work\nThe task of organizing communities is usually volunteer work done by people that see the value of doing \nit But at the same time it does usually impact their personal and family time Thats why when you \nare willing to help it is always useful When community organizers can share the load with multiple \npeople each person has to put in less time themselves the community can do more and the whole \ngroup benefits from greater results\nWhen offering to help dont try to just do the things that you want to do Those already involved in \norganizing the community will have ideas on how the community should be run what its goals are \nand what needs to be done in the future Start by listening What do the existing organizers want to \ndo See whether there are things that you can help with\nThat may involve doing some tasks that are not extremely rewarding nor very visible especially in \nthe beginning Trivial things such as arranging the chairs at an inperson meeting before the event \nstarts tidying up the room once the event finishes and receiving people at the door may seem of little \nimportance but are actually very important Someone  has to do it and if you volunteer for it you help \nfree up the organizers to focus on the speakers and vendors\nHelp like this is extremely appreciated precisely because it is not glamorous and needs to be done When \nyou are willing to help in ways like this you will be seen as a giver who is interested in helping and \nwill gain the trust of the organizers With that you will quickly advance to more interesting activities \nOn the other hand if you just want to be involved to gain benefits and help with visible things you \nwill be seen as a taker and you will not be accepted into the inner circle\nOne more thing that is important to consider is that organizers usually do not have the time to think \nabout activities or help you get more involved If you just wait for the organizers to remember that \nyou are there to help it might never happen Also consider that sometimes people do not want to \nhelp but want to sound helpful so they just say if you need help call me  because they know no one \nwill have time to call\nSo the suggestion is that you show up and do whatever you can That will remind people that you are \nthere to help if there is anything else that can be done\nA couple of things you can do without waiting for anyone to tell you anything is to arrive a few minutes \nearly and see whether there is anything you can do Also especially if its your first time at a meeting \nmake sure to stay afterward help tidy things up and help close the placeBe Part of a Larger Group  Meeting People at User Groups and Meetups 134\nOften inperson events offer a hybrid option so you can offer to facilitate participation from online \nparticipants Utilize the chat function and encourage online participants to answer questions to increase \nengagement early in the event Ask questions such as where are you located Is this your first event \nor are you a regular attender  As the event progresses prompt them to offer their impressions or ask \nquestions of the speaker to keep them engaged and involved in the conversations\nY ou may need to do this multiple times until organizers can think of something that you can help \nwith Many people have started their community participation by being there frequently and then \nsuddenly becoming the person to help when one of the organizers could not come or someone left  \nfor a vacation\nThe benefits of getting involved\nDoing nonglamorous activities that are not directly related to software development may even take \nyou away from watching the presentation as well as taking time from your family or your studies \nThat sounds like a recipe for disaster and not something that will benefit your career\nBut in reality let us remind ourselves what communities can bring us As we pointed out at the \nbeginning of this chapter participation in communities gives us access to knowledge experience \nand influence That translates into you being evaluated more highly promoted faster and eventually \nearning more money\nThose are tangible career benefits More than any of that participation in communities will bring you \nfriendship help and support Also you are going to be able to help and support others increasing \nyour leadership and mentoring skills All of those are extremely positive benefits for your career\nNow for the most closely guarded secret people that spend time organizing and building the community \nget not only slightly better but hundreds of times even several orders of magnitude better results \nthan people that just participate Those that organize the community are more visible have a better \nreputation meet better contacts make friends with more important people have more access to \nvendors and speakers and much more Join  communities so you can help others and in many ways \nhelp yourself too\nDeepening your participation and your results\nHere are some steps for you to participate in communities the right way and get the best results\n1 Search for communities near you  where you can participate in person and help solve local \nproblems Bonus points if you can find communities that align with your longterm career goals\n2 Listen  Join the Discord server Slack channel Telegram group mailing list or whatever \ncommunication channel the community has Understand what the organizers need and what \nthe community is trying to do Also help newcomers to feel at easeDeepening your participation and your results\n 135\n3 Make yourself available for help  Introduce yourself to the organizers and offer help Make \nsure to be there if they ever need you\n4 Do things that need to be done even before anything is asked of you  Do things that are \nobviously needed Answer questions from newbies on the list Promote the communitys \npresentations and activities on your social media accounts Take pictures and share them with \nothers Clean up and tidy the place before you leave All of those are things that need to be \ndone and that no one needs to ask you to do\n5 Gently remind people  that you are there to help Make it easy for the organizers to ask for help \nEven organizers are wary of asking people to do things So remind them that you are there \nto help with anything thats needed Y ou may need to do this multiple times and you may need \nto gently insert yourself into some activities\n6 Show up  Be consistent and participate frequently Say hello to people in the chat Ask questions \nto speakers Participate in activities both online and in person Joining a community is a long\nterm strategy not something that works if you only show up sometimes\n7 Think about the members  not only about yourself Leaders are those who think about others \nWatch for what both other participants and organizers need and figure out how you can help them\n8 Share  the communitys activities the difficulties you have and the results of going to the \ntalks that youve had Share what you learned from the speakers Expand the reach of the \ncommunity by sharing whatever you can with whomever you can be it social media friends \nor work colleagues\n9 Grow the community  Bring people to participate Invite friends to come join you Promote the \ncommunity inside your company Share with managers the benefits you got from participating \nInvite experienced people in your company to join and share their experiences\n10 Deepen relationships in the community  As much as you need to grow the community you \nalso need to grow the relationships you have made inside the community Look for ways to \ncontinue to build on your connections in your user group space Share updates and look for \nways to deepen relationships by showing your consideration and looking for opportunities to \nshare experiences together Y ou

intelligence and build your conflict resolution skills Being \nable to sustain your community and develop relationships rests on being able to manage \ndisagreements and resolve conflicts\nThese are

element\n1 Introduction  This is the beginning of the story and incorporates expository information \nsuch as the setting and characters as well as any backstory information on the characters \nThis introduces the key elements of the story as well as an inciting incident that puts the plot \ninto action\n2 Turning pointprogressive complicationrising action  Once the inciting incident occurs \nrising action and complications start to happen This can bring us to the high point of the story\n3 Climax  This rising action results in the high point or climax of the story The main character \nfaces obstacles potentially a villain character in the story arc\n4 Falling action  Following the climax there is a falling action or uncertainty around the outcome \nof the story\n5 Resolution  The resolution brings the close of the story and completes any unanswered questions \nor issues with the characters\nThe following is a simplified example\n Inciting incident  I walk into work on a rainy

Schedule it into your day at a time that works best for you and monitor \nyour use and time to ensure that you are allowing time for your other priorities and responsibilities \nSince you have immediate and constant access to social media through your phone or other devices \nat any time it is an activity that warrants close monitoring regarding the time spent using it Set time \nlimits and boundaries\nOne other thing to keep in mind with your use of social media is that the internet has a long memory \nOnce you have said something on the internet it lasts forever It is best to act with caution in your social \nmedia posts as well as your likes and shares comments and retweets Keep your professional brand \nand goals for social media in mind as you post and determine which posts are appropriate to like or \nshare Those decisions will be considered by the public as endorsements or reflections on your brand\nFinally when you are reaching out to people online keep in mind networking etiquette and best \npractices Let people know how they can help you but be careful not to place pressure on them A \ngood first step is to ask questions and gather information Respect that other people have their own \ntime limits and boundaries Reciprocate when someone offers to make a connection for you or a \nreference Share knowledge with people and be free with your praise and compliments Remember \nto stay connected after an initial introduction or conversation and always send a thank you\nInterviews\nMary Grygleski\nQ Hi Mary How are you today Im so happy youre going to be sharing with us a little bit about \nyour career Why dont we start with you telling us your full name and what youre doing now in your \ncareer and how you got started in your career as a developerInterviews\n 151\nA My name is Mary Grygleski Im currently the developer advocate for the streaming team at DataStax\nDataStax is a company that primarily does Apache Cassandra and open source stuff Then two years \nago they started also incorporating Apache Pulsar to support more new features such as event \nstreaming so I got hired for the streaming team\nIm a developer advocate so I go out and do outreach work doing presentations going to conferences \nand contributing to books such as this one There are a lot of virtual conferences and outreach \nopportunities and I enjoy it a lot\nAs for how I got here its actually very interesting I didnt start out as a developer advocate I was \na math and computer science major many years ago and at that time computer science was still \nnew Oracle was just starting to become popular and the SQL standard was just starting so that tells \nyou how old I am All those things were starting to brew so I was thinking Oh I just want to be a \nprogrammer  I didnt know about the internet yet I liked the more lowerlevelcompileroperating\nsystemtype work I thought I would try to work there but it wasnt as easy to find jobs in those areas\nI started off as a developer programmer for a chemical company in the IT department and thats \nhow I started my work I was working on older stuff such as Fortran and a very old prerelational \ndatabase Eventually I got more C and Unix work in the 1990s Thats when Java was also born and \nso I became interested in that too I joined Sybase because they were a way into doing enterpriselevel \nJava I was mostly a development engineer there\nI did not think I would become a speaker I was more of a typical nerd head down coding working \nwith fancy algorithms But eventually it just started to get to me After 15 years of working like that \nI wanted to do something different but I was not quite sure what it was\nAnd then at the time I was also in the middle of moving with my family I moved to Chicago and \nthere werent as many product engineering jobs there I got into doing a bit more applicationlevel \nengineering and application development work and then I worked at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \non the financial use of Java That gave me a new appreciation of things learning about the user side\nSo long story short I was following this path and I felt like something was missing In the meantime \ntoo I attended a couple of conferences Conferences were beginning to become a thing Of course \nJavaOne started which I went to an early version of  it was exciting I realized I really liked something \nbut didnt quite know what it was\nFast forward to the early 2010s and it was time to take the plunge I saw that user groups were becoming \na thing I joined the Chicago Java user group and I started attending a lot At the time Freddy was \nthe president and he said Oh why dont you come and help I said OK Why not I attended \nevery single meetup I never missed it I like talking with people getting to know them and finding \nout whats going on I found myself learning a lot that way just by interacting with people and thats \nhow I got involved with CJUG\nEventually Freddy moved away and I became president To this day Im the president  I didnt even \nimagine that happening And because of my involvement with CJUG I also got opportunities Because Grow Your Network through Social Media 152\nof my interaction with the community people began to know who I was CJUG used to have lightning \ntalks by members and I remember the first time I thought of doing it I was really nervous preparing \nfor a fiveminute talk took me two weeks But that was the start of my speaking career Once youve \ngot over that hump you realize Oh it isnt so bad \nI started doing a bit more community talking IBM was forming the Java advocacy team at the time \nand because of my involvement in the community people started to know me which meant I got the \nopportunity to become a Java developer advocate at IBM\nThats how I started my career as a developer advocate After five years Im still an advocate Im traveling \na lot and I absolutely love it Its all down to the community and talking with people I just find I have \nthis need even though Im still an engineer in some ways I would like to be by myself thinking of \nthings and solving problems but I also really like interacting with people It gives me another level of \nappreciation Its something I really enjoy talking and meeting with people\nQ Being a developer advocate like you said combines those two Y oure a developer and you also \ntalk about it so you developed all the skills that are required\nHow has using social media helped you in your career What are some examples of things that have \nhelped you to open new relationships in your career through participating on social media How do \nyou use social media\nA Currently I have social media I use Twitter a lot of the Java community uses Twitter too to \ncommunicate about whats going on in Java I think its good because you start to see the names of \npeople if they are more vocal Y ou start to see people and people start to see you and you can be \ntagged by people Thats important too Y ou can be the best out there but if nobody knows you it \ndoesnt mean much Y ou need social media to advertise yourself to make yourself known Its not \nabout boasting As a professional you need to make yourself known because the more people know \nyou the more trust you build with people that are following you or looking for somebody like you\nAs a developer advocate I advertise all the product capabilities my company has In some ways its \npart of my work I need to rely on social media Through that medium I can essentially bring messages \nto the world so that is very important\nI also have a Twitch stream although I have to admit these days Im traveling too much to consistently \ndo many streams But I have to say with the pandemic during those two or three years of not being \nable to travel I developed my skills too because initially I had never really streamed before Through \ntrial and error I started to learn how to do it\nBecause of my Twitch stream people started following me  they are quite loyal too I also set up a \nDiscord server so I can then communicate with people outside Twitch I met people from Norway \nIndia Malaysia everybody was following me  it was amazing Then I was in Oslo for JavaZone \nand a guy from Twitch came out to see me even though he was busy That was amazing to meet him \nin personInterviews\n 153\nIts interesting to get to know people and learn what their world is like Thats what I like to do its \nnot just about me when I meet people As a developer advocate Im building up developer relations \nThats how you build a relationship you let people know you and then you have a common interest \nI didnt just meet the guy in Norway but another person in Lithuania also We got to meet in Vilnius \nand these days he asks me whether  I can help him with stuff and for mentoring\nIts amazing It feels like there is a ripple effect after you meet with people all over the world Y ou \nrealize their problems their aspirations everything is just the same But the thing is its nice to share \nso you can then help people\nQ Y ou gave two great examples of using Twitter for your job but also to establish trust which is \nsomething that we talked about earlier in the book thats important to advance your career Y ou also \nmentioned looking for opportunities during the pandemic and using Twitch to expand your network \nand communicate via Discord\nDo you have any tips for time management Sometimes people can get easily distracted with social \nmedia Do you have any tools or techniques that youve used to balance social media with other things \nthat you need to do in your career such as development work or writing presentations\nA It is all about constant contextswitching\nTo borrow computer terms Im in an operating system where I find myself having to context switch \nall the time It is a challenge its not easy I could be writing proposals for a conference six or nine \nmonths ahead of time and then there are also proposals for talks that Im planning to do that need \nwriting Then there are things that I need to do for tomorrows conference\nI dont know whether there are any tips but one thing is true theres just no time for regrets When I \nwas an engineer I used to think Oh I didnt do this well  and then I would just lament over the thing \nI didnt do well that consumes energy and time But these days because everything happens so fast \nI have to keep doing something and just look ahead which I actually enjoy thoroughly I find I dont \neven pay any attention to regrets I have no regrets basically If I make mistakes I make mistakes I \njust keep going I think that might be the best way\nI just have my goals Every day I know what I need to do I write down a list of things I need to do \n interviews streaming on Twitch presentations flight reservations I know what I need to do and \nthen I go through them\nIt does take up a lot of time Sometimes I need to do some things over the weekend as well but thats \njust part of the job Because of how passionate I am about doing what I do I dont even mind\nSo the point is that there is no time to regret and look back Just keep going I developed this skill \nand its great because theres really no point in regretting things Whatever you do every day its a joy \nJust embrace it whether good or bad The more you embrace it the better you get at it That is just \npart of life  it extends beyond just being a developer advocateGrow Your Network through Social Media 154\nMaybe its not for everybody but for me it certainly works I find myself being a better person because \nof it I dont regret things now If I make mistakes I just say OK  My skin is getting thicker and I \ndont really worry Let other people criticize me Thats my way of handling it\nQ That makes sense I read something about that just a couple of days ago I was talking about \nlamenting things that may have happened in the past youre the only one whos thinking about it  no \none else even remembers most likely Y oure only taking up more of your time thinking about what \nyou shouldnt have done or should have done Keep moving forward Amazing advice\nCongratulations on your career success and thank you so much for sharing your story\nA Thank you Heather\nTrisha Gee\nQ Welcome Trisha Gee Thanks for agreeing to be in the book\nA Im Trisha currently working at Gradle a Java Champion and lead developer advocate  or developer \nevangelist These titles are all a bit fluffy arent they\nI got into programming when I was quite young  9 or 10  like a lot of people do but I did take a \nvery classical route Im from the UK and I did computer science at A level which is from 16 to 18 \nand then I did a computer science degree computer science and artificial intelligence\nThat was a fairly classical way to get into a programmingtype role I was very lucky in that I went to \nuniversity from 1997 to 2001 they were teaching Java and we were the first year to learn it So we \ngot really lucky I d already done a bit of programming before then I did Pascal at school and I did \nBasic before then Then I did an internship at Ford while I was at university and we did a little bit of \nASP and VB and things like that But really it was when I got into Java at university that I thought \nOh right This feels like something I can get I understand how it works \nWhen I left university in 2001 there were lots and lots of roles in Java JSP was a new thing servlets \nwere a new thing and the web was a fairly new thing I d been doing web stuff when I worked at Ford \nin my internship So looking back it was fairly easy to fall into a Java job It wasnt because it was 2001 \nit was during the dotcom crash and things were a bit tricky The thing that really helped me out was \nhaving an undergraduate internship as well as a computer science degree and a working background \nin writing web apps in Java and ASP \nOne thing eased my passage my dad is a careers teacher and he said that when you come out of \nuniversity there are going to be a lot of people who have the same qualifications as you and you have \nto stand out from the crowd and get in the door for those first few roles An internship or sponsored \nstudent program is a good way to get handson experience in a realworld organization Then you can \nuse that to open doors to everything you could possibly want In 2001 when the crash was happening Interviews\n 155\nit was really important that I had 18 months of actual work experience and my degree to go out and \nfind myself that first job\nAs for those first few jobs in the early noughties a lot of what we had was web developmenttype \nroles I did a bunch of stuff with JSP  servlets Java backends and a bit of JavaScript on the frontend \ntoo in Netscape and Internet Explorer Nobody uses any of those things anymore\nThe thing thats interesting to tell juniors is that your first few roles are not necessarily indicative of \nwhat all jobs in the industry are like My advice to junior developers is that youve got to have a bit of a \nPokmon mindset Y ouve got to catch them all Y ouve got to get out there get your skills and get skills \non your CV  Try taking up jobs that you might not ordinarily be super excited about because what youre \ntrying to do is build up a skill base and learn about what you do and dont enjoy Learn what different \ntypes of companies are like learn how different teams work Y ou need to understand that working \nin a place where you feel uncomfortable doesnt necessarily mean that the whole industry is not for \nyou There are different domains different technologies and different types of roles I know a bunch \nof people who went from development into technical writing business analysis technical leadership \nand architecture Y ou dont know whats going to suit you until youve had a taste of everything which \nis one of the reasons why I jumped around quite a lot in the early few years of my career\nQ Ace Obviously youve been successful and thats great advice at the beginning building up your \nskill set\nTell us a little bit about how you started once you were into your career the first few times you got \ninvolved in the community and when you felt like being involved in the technical community made \nan impact on your career\nA The community was one of those huge levelup things\nIve played computer games forever and when youve played a bunch of computer games you realize \nthat you can just keep plodding along doing what youre supposed to do but what youre really looking \nfor is those magic coins that give you that extra ability help you get more experience and help you \nto move on For me the community was one of those things Y ou can be perfectly successful in your \ncareer without these things  without community and so forth  by being good at your job finding \nthe right niche and continuing to work in that niche But for me the community was a huge levelup\nI worked in New Y ork for a year and then I came back to London I d already worked in London I had \nfriends and a network there but this was in 2008 This was after the next recession This is a common \ntheme for me it seems as the recessions hit things I decide to make major changes in my career\nI came back to London in 2008 which was an important decision for me At that point I had about \n10 years of experience as a Java developer but I wouldnt call myself senior more like midtosenior \nlevel I was looking for my next role I was looking for something I had worked in the city in London \nbeforehand I d been working in finance in New Y ork as a consultant and I found that interesting and \nchallenging At this point in my career I was able to know the sorts of things I didnt like the sorts of \nplaces I didnt want to work and what was going to interest meGrow Your Network through Social Media 156\nNow if you speak to recruitment agents to try and get yourself a new job you can keep having those \ncalls and interviews and going onsite to meet all these people but what I found when I lived in New \nY ork was that theres a great website called meetupcom  where you can meet people who have \nsimilar interests So when I moved back to London I used it to join the London Java Community I \nwas going to Java meetup events and I was learning about technologies that I was not familiar with \nsuch as AWS Spring had moved on a bunch so I was learning about new things in Spring I was \nspeaking to a lot of people who worked for gambling technology companies London has a bunch of \ngambling technology finance gaming and mobile app companies I was talking to lots of people who \nworked in these different types of companies getting a feel for the technologies they use how they \nwork what they like about their job and what they do not like about their job\nFirstly I used the community in a very selfish way if you like to figure out what my next job was \ngoing to be and to try and get that next job It didnt directly help me get that next job but it did open \nmy eyes to what was around and what people were doing It got me interested in speaking events and \nthe fact that apparently normal human beings can speak at these types of events Its not just experts \nand book authors any old developer can do it\nAfter I got my next job which happened to be at LMAX working with Dave Farley and a bunch of \nother people who ended up becoming quite famous afterward I was still going to the London Java \nCommunity I got more involved in helping to organize community events and trying to create slightly \ndifferent types of events because what I was really looking for was something more networky and \nmore peopletalky than just presentations\nThen I started giving my first couple of presentations and stuff My first presentation was on the JCP \nwhat the JCP is what the JSR is and what the executive committee is It was a 15minute introductory \npresentation because the LJC had just joined the JCP at the time Gradually over a couple of years \nor so that really helped me It gave me a lot of visibility into the technical community what people \nwere doing what was relevant and what wasnt relevant\nThen at LMAX we open sourced a technology called the Disruptor We wrote a white paper on it \nWe were doing developeradvocacytype stuff early on this was about 2010 As a result of that the \nDisruptor won the Dukes Choice Award and we got a ticket for someone in the company to attend \nJavaOne My boss was already going because he was presenting so they gave the ticket to me because \nI d done a bunch of work around getting the Disruptor known out there\nI went to JavaOne 2011 and that was where the whole community thing just exploded for me in a \nvery positive way I went with Martin Thompson who knew a bunch of people in the performance \nfield people like Kirk Pepperdine and the folks at Azul and a bunch of other folks who are really \nwell known in the Java performance space But I was also there with Martijn Verburg and he knew \na bunch of people from the community from the JCP  and from user groups I got introduced to a \nhuge range of people I wasnt just parachuted into a conference and stuck on my own going Oh \nI dont really know anyone  I didnt know many people when I got there but by the end of it I had \nmade all these amazing connections in a few different areas user groups the JCP  performance and \nopen source My career was just never the same after thatInterviews\n 157\nI actually copresented with Martin there but it wasnt so much the presenting  it was just about the \ncommunity that was physically there at JavaOne making those connections and being included in \nthose groups automatically without having to fight my way in\nFrom there on everything snowballed I had new job opportunities I had more speaking opportunities \nAfter doing that one thing at JavaOne I got four or five speaking opportunities off the back of it I \nmade a bunch of new friends I ended up doing more blog posts and I got a following on my blogs \nThats what steered me into the developer advocacy thing JavaOne and meeting the community\nQ Y es I remember meeting you there Its amazing how that pivoted your career or amplified all the \nthings you d already been doing to gain skills\nY ouve started to talk about blogs Can you share a story about how you have used social media to \nadvance your career\nA I ended up going to work for Thoughtworks around 2011 Whenever I wasnt placed with a client \nI had time to start writing blog posts which I d wanted to do for a long time I had been on Twitter \nfor probably about four years and a friend of mine Simon Brown spoke at conferences and was on \nTwitter sharing the things he was writing I thought of him as being way better than me but he was \nultimately at a peer level of me and he was doing these sorts of things So I thought Oh I could \nwrite blog posts and tweet about them and I could get involved in building this kind of audience \nand community \nIt happened very organically I would write a bunch of blog posts about stuff that I hadnt really \nunderstood very well once I figured it out I d write it down I wrote a bunch of stuff about being a \nwoman in tech because people always want to know what its like being a woman in tech I wrote a \nbunch of stuff about why I got really annoyed about being asked about being a woman in tech because \nits very frustrating\nI just wrote about stuff that I wanted to know about stuff that was based on personal experience Is it \nfrightening to do that Its a bit difficult to get started because youre worried that people are going to \nsay Oh I cant believe you didnt know that  or you worry about people piling on about the women \nin tech thing which they do sometimes But ultimately if you write about these things and people \nsay Oh thats really interesting I didnt know that  you get a nice positive feedback loop If you start \nputting it on Twitter then you get more people following you because they see that you tweet about \nyour content\nLater on before I started working at JetBrains I would read especially when I had a commute a lot \nof interesting blog posts because I was a big reader Every time I read stuff if it was really interesting \nI would put a really short summary on Twitter with a link to the blog post People started following \nme because I would tweet interesting and relevant stuff with a TLDR so they dont even need to read \nthe blog postGrow Your Network through Social Media 158\nSo I started to develop a social media following because Im a developer whos interested in stuff and \nwants to share that stuff not because I have any particular highlevel expertise in one area Im just \ninterested in stuff let me share what Im interested in with you Thats how I organically grew a lot of \nmy social network\nThe other thing was when I started going to conferences more At conferences we would use Twitter \na lot you use the conference hashtag and you start talking about the sessions that youre seeing or the \nobservations that youve made I made quite a few friends that way because you d end up chatting to \npeople who were using the same hashtag\nI remember I was at JAX London I didnt really know anyone at that conference but because I was \ntweeting quite a lot a few people came up to me  and obviously there are not many women either \nSo people would say Y ou must be Trisha Y ouve been tweeting a bunch about this conference  They \ncome up to you and talk to you and you make friends and expand your community and your network \nThats how I met a whole bunch of people that I now consider to be friends and peers in the industry\nTwitter was really important to me in terms of building a following but also finding a voice What is \nit that youre good at What works for you what resonates with you and what do people like about \nthe things that you do That can help you steer your career as well Thats how I ended up in advocacy \nOne of the things Im good at is taking stuff thats complicated condensing it down and sharing it \nwith people Then because thats the sort of thing that you do people approach you and say Do you \nwant to work for us or Do you want to write an article in our magazine on these sorts of topics or \nDo you want to present at our conference These are the sorts of things that we want you to present \non  Its a positive feedback loop where the more that you do stuff the more followers you get the \nmore opportunities come your way and the more you say yes to those things Then you can end up \nin videos from conferences on Y ouTube and youre answering questions on Y ouTube and youve got \na completely different social media platform to follow\nAgain a bit like the Pokmon thing its all about trying to gather things for yourself doing what works \nfor you using the things that youre good at and amplifying those things\nQ Its really interesting how its advanced your career meeting people\nIm wondering if you have any tips to share about consuming technology  Twitter LinkedIn Y ouTube \nHow do you make strategies for learning or finding content so that you can also have time to do your \nactual development and the work that you need to produce\nA That is really tricky\nI actually have a couple of talks on this topic I used to curate the newsletter when I worked at JetBrains \nI used to do the Java Annotated Monthly and that was quite challenging because it was a case of really \nstaying up to date with the news consuming it and figuring out what was relevant and what wasnt \nWhen I was in London it was a little bit easier because I had commute time and you just use that \ntime to skim through the things that seem either the noisiest or the most interesting I got used to Interviews\n 159\nthat kind of thing  particularly skimming stuff rather than reading things in depth to get a feel for \nwhats happening in trends and technologies\nThats something that I tend to do on the go If Im commuting or waiting for the kids outside school \nor if I happen to have half an hour to myself in a bar or while Im waiting for something then I will \ntry and skimread stuff Im not great at skimreading because I get really engrossed and I read things \nproperly but I will try and just skim through stuff quickly on the go and because youre doing it on \nthe go it forces you not to go too deep It just gives you an idea of Oh this is vaguely what this \ntechnology is for I see what some of these viewpoints are \nMy whole thing about staying up to date as a technologist is that it is impossible to know everything \nthats going on For juniors in particular my main advice for them is this dont get overwhelmed by \nthe fact that theres so much stuff out there because its impossible to stay up to date and therefore its \nabsolutely fine to focus only on the things that you find interesting\nFor example I decided Im only really interested in core Java  Java the language I have used Groovy \nObviously Ive used Kotlin Ive done the tiniest amount of Scala With those sorts of things I vaguely \nstay abreast If theres a major release I want to see vaguely whats in it Im not going to read the release \nnotes but I might read someone elses summary of whats interesting about it but Im not going to go \naway and learn that language Im going to do that for Java\nWhen Java 9 came out I spent quite a lot of time investigating what are the things that are potentially \ngoing to break What are the new features Why is it challenging to migrate Because that was interesting \nto me and to people who follow me on social media What they expect from me is to do that hard \nwork so that I can tell them Dont worry about this Do worry about that \nSo you want to focus on the things that are interesting to you and its fine to ignore the stuff thats not \ninteresting Its fine to just read the headlines and think Oh OK Theres a new version of Angular \nGreat OK Thats all I need to worry about right now  Its fine to then dive in later Lets say you move \nto a new job that uses Angular then you can do the tutorials and read more about it But you dont \nhave to stay an expert on absolutely everything because you wont use 999 percent of it Y oure only \ngoing to use a small amount of it\nBut it is worth surfing that tsunami of news I tend to pick through headlines and things to take the \npulse of whats going on Twitters useful for that in that you can take the pulse of what people are \ntalking about Its not super structured though and the algorithms obviously have changed a bit \nlately I use Twitter to try and hear from more diverse voices In the past when I started I had a lot \nof technology news on my Twitter Now I hear a lot more about peoples experiences from people \nwho are not necessarily middleaged white men who work for Twitter Some of the stuff I get is really \neyeopening but its not necessarily Heres whats new in Angular  It depends a lot on what you want \nto learn and how you want to learn itGrow Your Network through Social Media 160\nQ That is a good point to make  it depends What youre going to learn about is based on who youre \nfollowing so try to make sure that the people that you choose to follow are people whose viewpoints \nyoure interested in and make sure that its diverse\nA Exactly Especially because the algorithms tend to feed you stuff I got quite particular about the \ntypes of people I was following and the types of tweets I was liking or resharing because Im aware \nthat Im feeding the algorithm If I like something I know that Im going to get more of that back \nI always make a push to follow as many women techies on Twitter as possible I dont have to do it \nbut I think that its important for us to amplify each others voices because otherwise we tend to get \ndrowned among everyone else I generally follow women techies and people from underrepresented \ngroups more than others Well I follow plenty of the other folks as well but I make a deliberate effort \nto go out and find women techies and people who are not necessarily from the UK or the US  people \nfrom different backgrounds\nQ I think thats good but you just have to be deliberate about it because the algorithm typically will \nfeed you more of the same which is just more typical mainstream content so you have to make an \neffort to go out there and find diverse perspectives either from different parts of the world different \nparts of the industry a different gender or other different underrepresented groups out there\nA I know that there is a fair argument for how we shouldnt have to do this but the way the world \nis right now means that if you want to combat institutionalized bias which is not always intentional \nyou have to be intentional about the changes you want to make particularly as algorithms machine \nlearning and AI start to become even more prevalent We have to be aware of the fact that the way the \nworld currently is is being fed as a model into these computers so we will continually get the way the \nworld currently is fed back to us as the way the world is or should be We need to be very deliberate \nabout the fact that our experiences as white middleclass people in Western Europe  for example  \nare not the same as the experiences of developers in Africa India or any other place Its important to \nhear from others in any context but particularly when it comes to AI The kind of information were \nfeeding into our models is not complete It doesnt cover everyones experiences\nQ Thats always been an interesting aspect for me the training of AI models and whats going into \nthem and trying to educate about that so thanks for sharing that\nSummary\nIn this chapter we covered the basics of social media for technical career development personal versus \nprofessional social media usage how to build your online presence and how to reach out to people \nand have meaningful and careeradvancing conversations on social media\nIn the next chapter we will discuss how inperson conferences or even sometimes virtual conferences \ncan be used to advance your career10\nBuild Lasting Relationships\nInperson conferences or even sometimes virtual conferences can be used to advance your career \nAlthough online relationships can help advance your career nothing beats inperson contact \nInperson events and conferences can connect you to important people and companies and create \na deeper engagement with your network This chapter will show you the steps to add conferences to \nyour careerbuilding toolkit\nHeres what well specifically cover in this chapter\n How conferences can boost your career\n Finding the best conferences to attend\n Time and money  making your attendance worthwhile\n Making conference attendance an asset for your boss and your company\n Goal stacking  how to guarantee results while attending a conference\nLets begin\nHow conferences can boost your career\nConferences can boost your career through deep and longlasting relationships So how do you form \nthese relationships Y ou network with recruiters and engineers from companies you want to work \nfor in the future while you attend conferences Y ou may be surprised to find that job offers can result \nfrom your efforts to engage with people at conferences These interactions can form the basis for \nrelationships that may result in opportunities for career opportunities  maybe not now but more \nlikely in the future Most job offers are a result of an introduction via a connection in your network \nY ou may be able to apply for jobs in the future based on some of these interactions Conferences \nare a great opportunity to improve your networking skills Take the time to practice your skills by \nconsidering some alternative responses to common and expected questions Y ou can do this via \nconversation framing by asking questions instead of being the one always answering the questions \nGuide and frame the conversation in the way you want to steer it instead of just answering questionsBuild Lasting Relationships 162\nOne ideal response to a routine question is The better question is  Be prepared with specific and \nunique questions that are of interest to you rather than generic or basic small talk questions As you \nattend more conferences your network will expand and you will be able to connect with even more \npeople Conferences are an ideal place to connect with other likeminded people in your field They \ngive you the opportunity to introduce yourself to other people If you continue to build on your \nexperiences and attendance and be persistent you will begin to see concrete rewards as a result of \nthese efforts When you add the intense and intimate setting of a conference and repeat meetings with \ncommon interests and continued online interactions you will find a deeper relationship that can be \nlonger lasting than relationships that are formed through solely online interactions\nY ou will not only build deep and longlasting relationships that will boost your career through attending \nconferences but you will also learn new things that can help you to advance your career Y ou can \nenhance your learning about technologies you already know and use in your work Y ou can also learn \nabout new technologies trends or innovations and new uses for those technologies The conference \nis also a place to learn about projects you can join or start as you network with people and hear about \ntheir experiences with them In this smaller and more intimate environment you will forge bonds \nand initiate project engagement that can happen through shared experiences\nWhile you will experience these benefits most profoundly via inperson events you can also enjoy \nlearning networking and forming relationships via online conferences There are some events where \ndiscussions and interactive experiences can help to boost your career In most cases these events are \nbetter suited to learning as opposed to interaction but having a mix of events  some for learning \nand some with more inperson interaction  is a strategy that can offer complementary engagement \nin conferences allowing you to participate in a greater number of conferences over time\nFinding the best conferences to attend\nHow do you find the right conferences to attend Most likely you have discovered conferences in \nyour area of expertise from coworkers colleagues and the internet Research those conferences by \nlooking at their websites and social media presence Look at their agendas and review some of the \nsessions from preview editions Evaluate the quality of the speakers the content and the recordings \nY ou should also review the social media posts from previous editions of the event Ask members of \nyour team at work and members of any meetups or user groups you attend to share their conference \nexperiences as well One trend in event organization is that events are becoming smaller and much \nmore focused locally and regionally There may be one flagship event and then several regional or \nlocal events in various regions based on the main flagship event Y ou dont need to wait to attend the \nbiggest most international event in your field Y ou can find an event reasonably close to you to start \nyour experience and then build from there Once you start attending conferences you will find that \nyou discover more and more opportunities exponentially Y ou may even decide to travel to conferences \noutside of your local area country or continentFinding the best conferences to attend\n 163\nSince software developers need to know a variety of tools and techniques to complete their work \nthey need to learn about various programming languages data structurealgorithms objectoriented \ndesign database and system design operating systems cryptology source control cloud platforms \nframeworks and so on As we discussed earlier in this book the amount of learning required both \nin advance of getting hired and during your career can be overwhelming All of these types of tools \nand techniques have conferences to support the developers and their communities Use the criteria \nwe discussed to determine which areas you most enjoy and also the conferences that have something \nto learn from andor something you want to share with others Where do your passions lie Research \nthe conferences in those areas Once you have attended some conferences evaluate your experiences \nat the conference to decide whether it is something you would like to repeat in the future There are \na variety of aspects to consider including what you learn social interactions ancillary events at the \nevent and other factors that may be crucial to your experience\nIf you cant go to all of the best conferences ask people you trust respect and admire about their \nconference experiences If they describe an event that sounds interesting and appealing to you make \na plan to attend one of the conferences with them Y ou might have a desire to attend one of the biggest \nand most popular events Y ou will want to consider the bigger events  nearly every platform will have \none In the Java community the flagship international event is the JavaOne conference This is the \nevent that draws Java developers from all over the world and has been held since the early days of the \ntechnology This event provides a unique conference experience that doesnt compare to any other \nIf you are a Java developer this is an event that you will want to experience at least once There are \nalso many smaller events and regional events that you can attend Y ou may decide that you prefer to \nattend one type of event or another or you may want to attend a mix of events This could mean that \nyou attend multiple events a year or you may alternate events on an annual basis There are plenty \nof events to choose from but overall deciding on the best events for you will be a largely personal \ndecision based on your preferences as well as your goals for attending events\nWhat are your goals for attending events Remember to go back to your SMART goal framework\n S Smart\n M Measurable\n A Achievable\n R Relevant\n T Timebound\nDo you want to learn new skills or enhance your current skills Do you want to network and meet \npeople Do you want to participate in handson activities and get involved in more projects Depending \non your goals you may choose different events There are events that will help you to meet your goals \nDo your research and share your experiences while you read the experiences of others to determine \nwhich conferences are best for youBuild Lasting Relationships 164\nTime and money  making your attendance worthwhile\nThere is a cost to attend conferences How do you make the costs of both your time and money worth \nthe investment The word investment  is intentionally selected here because it is an investment in yourself \nIt costs you both your time and money  travel costs food and beverage costs and potentially time \nyou could be billing for compensation at an hourly rate There are some best practices for attending \nconferences that will help you to make your attendance worthwhile\nWhen you are attending conferences introduce yourself to others  this is the best way to get something \nout of the experience When you introduce yourself remember to be authentic Be yourself in personality \nand appearance Ask for their contact information and social media details Make sure to follow up \nwith a message and be specific with your followup\nReview the conference schedule in advance  sketch out a flexible schedule and select the sessions \nyou would like to attend in advance One option is to attend the session with someone you just met \nat the conference\nMake an effort to attend the sessions Y ou may be tempted to complete work projects attend meetings \nfor work or catch up on emails However in order to make your attendance at conferences worthwhile \nyou need to resist this urge and attend as many sessions as possible Y ou might be thinking that most \nof the sessions at conferences these days are recorded so you will watch them online later Will you \nreally watch them later Or if you do watch them later will you pay attention or will you be distracted \nand multitasking While you are attending sessions you can think of topics or methods you can \npresent yourself next year at the conference or other conferences Share what you have learned on \nsocial media blogs and so on Ask questions and introduce yourself to the speakers at the sessions \nyou attend Voice your opinions confidently and engage in conversations with them Take the time to \nexpress your appreciation to them Speakers put hours into planning preparing and delivering their \npresentations to audiences\nGo to informal social events These are some of the most critical moments to network with other \nattendees speakers or conference organizers Y ou may be tired after a full day of sessions but if you \nmake the effort to attend and consider making an effort a vital part of your conference attendance you \nwill reap more of the rewards of your conference experience Do not be tempted to catch up on sleep \nThis is not the time to rest and recover or sit alone in your room Immediately becoming accustomed \nto the local time zone is a best practice for global travel and beating jet lag\nAttend the keynotes and closing sessions The welcome keynotes and closing keynotes are especially \nvaluable because they frame the conference experience Y ou will not be able to attend all of the sessions \nduring the conference but the opening keynote will highlight not only the themes for the events \nbut also the top experiences during the week that you will not want to miss The closing keynote \nsimilarly will summarize the experiences that happened giving you a sense of some of the things \nyou may have missed or want to go back to experience These opening and closing keynotes are also \nsome of the most entertaining and illuminating sessions of the conference Often they will include \nthoughtprovoking bigpicture concepts relevant in the industry that will not be covered in the smaller Time and money  making your attendance worthwhile\n 165\nconference sessions Take the opportunity to experience them in person and also to capture some \nof your favorite moments on social media This will help to give you visibility at the conference with \nother conference attendees make sure to include the hashtags of the conference\nIn addition to the social events and keynotes you should also attend any of the evening sessions \nOftentimes conferences will hold evening sessions such as birdsofafeather sessions which are \ntypically informal questionandanswer type sessions or unconference sessions which are userdirected \nsessions organized spontaneously without a set agenda or topic announced in advance Both of these \ntypes of sessions are prime opportunities to engage and interact with other attendees and enhance \nwhat you learn at the conference\nOne of the most underrated aspects of attending conferences is what is often called the hallway \ntrack  This is the time you can use to socialize and hang out in any of the informal spaces in between \nbefore or after sessions This is a key time to meet other people have informal conversations walk \nthe exposition floor and engage with any exhibitors of interest and check out any special activities \nhappening on the featured area or stage hacker areas or contests happening These are not only fun \nbut also sometimes result in some of the most valuable interactions during conferences\nRemember to relax and have fun Be inclusive and make an effort to meet people different from \nyourself If you run into any issues or have special requests you can talk to conference organizers \nThe organizers want you to have an awesome experience so dont be afraid to speak up and ask for \nany accommodations you may need\nSome thoughts about virtual events\nThere are also an increasing number of virtual onlineonly or hybrid events In 2020 it became more \ncommon for software development conferences to be held in an online format and also in a hybrid \nformat A hybrid format is when some people might attend andor speak in person while some might \nattend online Online conferences provide educational benefits but it can be challenging to connect \nnetwork and form strong relationships in this format While you can connect with other people \nat virtual or hybrid events it is more difficult and challenging Y ou can maintain connections with \npeople you have met in the past and you can make new connections but the level of engagement will \nnot be as strong It is difficult to deepen relationships via online or remotehybrid conferences That \nbeing said it is not impossible Y ou should strive for a mix of inperson and onlinehybrid events \nIf you only have the opportunity to attend online events then by all means attend the events that \nyou can online Take the initiative to initiate connections at these online events Most of them offer \nsome form of online networking options When the opportunities to attend inperson events arise \ntake the steps to attend them Y ou will be rewarded with richer and more meaningful connections \nIt is great to attend in personBuild Lasting Relationships 166\nMaking conference attendance an asset for your boss and \nyour company\nIn many cases you are not the only one who is investing time and money for you to attend conferences \nIf you are employed unless you are selfemployed or an independent contractor you are also asking \nyour boss and your employer to make an investment in you via time and money How do you make \nyour conference attendance an asset for your boss and your company In addition to the steps we \noutlined in the previous section you will want to plan your conference selections and attendance based \non how your employer will benefit from the experience not just how you personally will benefit\nY ou can view the conference keeping in mind how the content you learn will benefit any projects you \nwork on for your employer This can be a project you work on with your team a project by another \nteam or a crossorganizational project Bringing back the knowledge you learn and applying it to \neither your team or another team will make the experience an asset to your boss and your company\nY ou may even be able to bring back lessons learned to help inform your employer about a potential \nproject you plan to work on in the near future Search for these opportunities in advance of your \nconference attendance Think about projects and technologies that your employer may benefit from \nand have conversations with members of the leadership team about their priorities and trends This \nshowcases you as an asset to your employer and positions you as a proactive strategic thinker and \nsolver of the problems facing your business This also reinforces your plan to attend conferences for \nyour own professional development as well as for the benefit of the company and future projects This \nwill put you in a position that few software developers will be in  poised for opportunities to advance\nIn addition to bringing back knowledge for your employer you can share the work your employer \nand your team undertake at the conference This could be either informally via networking and \nconversations or it could be via a more formal presentation just be sure to obtain the necessary \nreview and clearance before disclosing information about your employer in public This positions your \nemployer as a top choice and your boss as an asset to that employer Attracting and retaining top talent \nis a valuable asset to your employer Y ou can also search for potential talent and refer people who you \nmeet at conferences to your network filling specific needs and roles your team or employer may have\nGoal stacking  how to guarantee results while attending \na conference\nIf you want to guarantee success and results while attending a conference get specific about your \ngoals Even better be SMARTER  about your goals Make these kinds of goals for each conference \nyou attend and use this model in general as well Review your goals before during and after your \nconference experience If you can dream it and draft goals around it you can achieve it Make at least \nthree goals for each conference you attend They can be in various categories  learning networking \nprojectbased for personal professional development or for the benefit of your employer They can \nbe aspirational to achieve a new position or become a speaker or mentor Articulate what it is that Interview\n 167\nyou intend to achieve What are your intentions with this experience Y ou can guarantee your results \nif you put your mind to achieving the goals set\nFor example here are three goals when attending your next conference\n Learn four new features in the upcoming Java release\n Gather experience in two different corporate migrations to the latest Java release to inform \nyour migration project at work\n Talk with five contacts who are participating in open source projects that you use and whose \nexperiences and recommendations you are interested in enabling you to become a contributor \nto an open source project\nOnce you set your goals share them in advance and review them before during and after the conference \nto ensure you are on track to meet your goals Hold yourself accountable to your goals by sharing \nthem with someone you trust  a friend mentor or colleague Watch as you achieve your results\nInterview\nIxchel Ruiz\nQ Ixchel Ruiz is a developer advocate at JFrog Shes highly active in the Java developer community \nand has some excellent stories to share with us about her conference experiences and her career path \nfrom developer and consultant to developer advocate Welcome Ixchel\nA Hi Heather Thank you very much for having me Im super excited about being here with you\nQ Y our stories and your career journey fit so nicely into this particular season Its serendipitously \nhappened that your story is a perfect fit to talk about this book how youve managed to shape it the \nway that you wanted it to be and how the experiences that youve had participating in the community \nhave helped to bring you to where you are today\nLets just start with you sharing the story of how that happened and then I can ask you a few questions \nabout it\nA Sure But before we start I wanted to show you how interesting is this Im right now in a hotel \nroom because I was participating in Devoxx UK Conferences and being in the limelight are part of \nmy life today\nAs you mentioned Heather Im a software developer Java is my tool of choice I have been doing this \nfor more than 20 years Before I became a developer advocate although I still say become because its \na work in progress as our careers always are I had more than 20 years of experience as a consultant \nThat means I had a public face because I had to see my clients and move from team to team but I also \nhad an extra public face My passion for community work for sharing knowledge made me jump \ninto speaking at conferences and that is exactly what pivoted my career as a developer and took it to \nthe next level It opened doors for other skills and other opportunities for growthBuild Lasting Relationships 168\nQ Could you share a little bit about how you started doing that As a consultant how did you begin \nto participate in conferences Sometimes its all about that first step Thats what I found because Ive \nalso participated in conferences Once you start to participate you find the next opportunity arises \nand you step through that door Maybe it d be helpful if you shared how you first started to have those \ncommunity experiences  attending and speaking at conferences\nA Attending conferences was interesting Im going to be completely frank  the reason why I started \nto attend conferences was the opportunity to learn and improve my skills I really wanted to know \nabout new technologies what to be learning and so on\nI started speaking at conferences because it was one of the only ways to actually get a conference \nticket At that time they were too expensive for me to afford When I started my company was into \nthe continuous development of their developers I was still back in Mexico so my only opportunity \nto get to different conferences was as a speaker It was such a challenge but Im happy that I took it \nThere is never a better way to learn a topic inside out than having it to explain to other developers\nQ Exactly Thats one of the tips that I typically give to firsttime speakers if theyre not sure what topic \nto present  pick something you want to learn and then share your experience learning it\nMaybe you can share what your first topic was how you selected it and what it was like when you \nspoke for the first time\nA The topic that I felt would be pressurefree to talk about was testing This was maybe 17 years ago \nAt the time even though we knew that testing was super important it was still the ugly duckling in \nthe family Everybody knew that we had it but we knew we didnt want to interact that much with it\nThat was my opportunity I knew that it was my opportunity I went into testing I love the concept and \nI love making it easy because I know all the drawbacks At the time people were saying We cannot \nspend a lot of time on it We cannot spend a lot of resources on it  I knew that if I talked about it from \na perspective that assumed that it was not expensive or difficult but easy enjoyable and expressive \nthat would be a good way to approach it I talked about my favorite libraries to test\nQ Thats great I love that example Sometimes you feel like everyone else can speak about a certain \ntopic better than you can when you havent spoken before and so finding a topic that you dont see \nother people talking about having an interest in it and finding your own niche is perfect\nY ou had 20 years of working as a consultant participating in the community getting your face well \nknown and expanding your network What propelled you or motivated you when you decided you \nwanted to shift from being a consultant to taking a job as a developer advocate\nA That was interesting tooInterview\n 169\nWhen I started traveling and conferences started appreciating my contributions more I start expanding \nmy network with fellow speakers and conference organizers Were very involved in the tech community \nand in this case the Java community  its super supportive welcoming and very vibrant Ive met \nwith a lot of passionate people and suddenly years later I might meet them at different conferences \nin different parts of the world They know me and they know what I do When you are a speaker \nyou share part of your personality your passion and what drives you When you work on different \nprojects people already know you Y ou dont have to have those conversations anymore\nOne of my friends and colleagues of some years  were from totally different companies but were \nfriends because we have met so many times at different conferences and other events  came to me \nand said Ixchel there is a spot for you in my developer relationships team Do you want to come \nand join I said yes because I wanted to try this new path and it was totally different from the world \nof a consultant Sometimes its easy to jump between the two sometimes its not so easy But in this \ncase it was a good fit because people already knew my work\nQ And how do you do that  share your passion Especially for women that Ive talked to in their \ncareers their focus is more on the work But what struck me in your story of promotion from consultant \nto developer advocate was that it was fueled by your excitement\nWhat tips do you have for being confident enough to share a passion and take a break from just \ngetting work done Because that is really what promoted you from being in your current role as a \nconsultant to being a developer advocate Y ou shared and people could see your passion and your \nexcitement for topics\nA Well the answer there is a little bit easy and a little bit complicated\nThe easy part is to find a dream an inspiration When things go wrong you will still have a bad day \n your demo is going to crash Y our computer is not going to work People are going to leave your \nsession and you are going to feel miserable So you need that inspiration that dream that driving \nforce to make those bad days good days at the end of the day\nIn my case and I think this is something that a lot of women out there can sympathize with the \ndream is that I want more women in our industry I want a woman on the conference stage and I want \nother people to say that it is normal to see a woman that is good at technical things a woman that is \ngood at communication a woman that is willing to share a woman that brings a new perspective to \ncurrent topics or old topics a woman that actually shows something at the bleeding edge I want that \nI want normalization and inspiration\nThats why I do it even though public speaking is not my first choice Its still terrifying for me I still \ncriticize myself a lot  did I deliver it correctly Did I bring something interesting to the audience \nIs the audience happy What would the audience really warm to Did I bore them to death I still \nstruggle with all of that but my dream is bigger than thatBuild Lasting Relationships 170\nQ Exactly I think it is important to normalize and share our stories of success because it isnt something \nthat you see all the time I love what you said about normalizing having women on the stage  I agree \nY oure providing that example for people\nCan you share with us a little bit about how your daytoday life is different as a developer advocate \nversus when you worked as a consultant and attended conferences in your free time\nA Attending conferences is very demanding on our free time because we usually have events and \ntechnical sessions in the mornings and later on there are plenty of opportunities to do networking \nand talk to attendees speakers and organizers So they are fullday events\nWhen Im on the road I have to focus on all that but I still have a job I still need to generate content \nand coordinate with different teams For example as a developer advocate you do sessions and most \noften you do them with your partners These are technical partners which means other companies \nso its a balancing act\nThis profession and this particular job role are not for the faint of heart because sometimes youre \non another continent  youre battling time zones and youre battling people all around the world \nwith different time constraints and different goals Y our team and the teams that you interact with \nare not like your own developer teams where everybody has a set schedule and you share a project \nand a sprint Y ou have a long relationship with your home team But as a developer advocate on the \nroad you face other teams with different time constraints and different domains of expertise I deal \na lot with marketing but also with sales and product managers\nIn that regard it has been an interesting challenge I still do my developer work coding as well as \nthe other public part  attending conferences networking and talking to developers Its a full life\nQ But a fun one\nA An amazing one I mean look at me Im still really passionate about this\nQ I can tell I know that you have a great time doing it and Im really pleased that you were able to \nsuccessfully have that career transition\nIf theres anyone out there who is interested in becoming a developer advocate what advice would \nyou give them\nA Find the technology that you like to talk about because you need to have a lot of passion If youre \nnot passionate about it its going to be a little bit more difficult\nSecondly there is a lot of learning that you have to do very fast but thats beautiful in itself Find a \ntechnology a library a language  whatever you feel that you can understand and can communicate \nto others about  and then go deepSummary\n 171\nThe community is also important Find an awesome community and you will feel welcomed Y ou will \nlearn from the developers and other people involved in whatever technology you pick\nQ Great tips  be passionate be good at learning and learning fast and engage with the community \nSo often you can engage with the community online but being able to engage in person face to face \nis when you really deepen the connections and engagement that youre able to have Even if you cant \ntravel but engage locally you can find those inperson opportunities to forge those deep connections\nA Y es Go to meetups and go to hackathons Even contribute to open source because when you \ncontribute to open source you generate a channel of communication with contributors or maintainers \nof projects Those are the first steps to engaging fellow developers in a totally different conversation \nBelieve me that will open a lot of doors for you\nQ Theres the handson aspect too  hackathons meetups conferences They are handson activities \nwhere you gain experience learn new skills and forge relationships Its almost like everything is all \nin one place when you are able to find those opportunities\nWell thank you Ixchel for sharing your career story and congratulations on your transition as a \ndeveloper advocate I look forward to seeing you in person again at another conference very soon \nand I hope that you enjoy the rest of your time in London\nA Thank you very much Heather and I am so looking forward to seeing you soon face to face because \nI love hugging you\nQ Me too and thanks for sharing\nSummary\nIn this chapter

contributing to open source\nThe primary value of contributing  to open source projects is that it gives you access to awesome \nsoftware that you can modify for your needs Y ou also gain the following\n Knowledge\n Skills\n Opportunities to work on impactful projects\n Purpose\n Friendship\n Opportunities for networkingBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 176\n Access to amazing developers\n A portfolio\n The ability to build your reputation\nWhen developers talk about open source they usually mean participating in open source projects or \ncontributing code to libraries or software they use and like\nThe definition of open source itself comes from the Open Source Initiative  OSI It is a set of rules  \non how to license software in a way that allows people to learn from it by having access to the source \ncode Y ou can modify the source code for your own purposes and publish the modifications for \nothers The open source definition creates the basic ground rules that allow all of us to benefit from \nand contribute to open source projects In this book were not going to discuss open source licensing \nBut you should be aware of licenses especially if you start to use open source inside your company\nMany people refer to open source projects and developers as a community But in reality because open \nsource is organized around projects it is more like many communities each built around a project \nThis is important because although there is a definition of what constitutes open source software \nthere is no specific standard of what it is and how a community should organize itself So there are \nas many types of different communities as there are open source projects After all there are open \nsource projects about absolutely everything you can imagine That is why it is easier to think about \nopen source in relation to a specific project\nThink about each open source project as a community by itself Each is a community of people working \ntogether to improve a project or solve a particular problem Each project has its own community of \nusers big or small that it serves\nIf contributing to open source is only valuable for other people that is for the community and users \nof the project it is reasonable to question why you should do it It is common to hear questions such \nas why should I work for free Or why do so many developers work for free on open source projects \nThose are valid questions Although some developers are paid to work on open source projects that \nis not the norm Most developers participate in open source for other reasons This is a good place to \nstart our exploration of the open source world Let us explore some of the reasons why you might be \ninterested in using and contributing to open source software\nA word about meritocracy\nA lot has been said about open source  and how it is a meritocracy When you hear that it is easy  to \nassume that it is because the best and top developers are the ones building open source software That \nis their merit But in reality the meritocracy that is mentioned is basically who is putting in more \neffort In open source projects people that put more work and more focus into the project tend to be \nthe most respected and end up setting the direction of the work\nY ou may find that this is very positive because it is not about how good you are today that will allow \nyou to join an open source project but how much effort and focus you are willing to put into it  A word about meritocracy\n 177\nThe more effort you put in and the more help you provide the better you become as a professional \nand a developer\nEvery open source project needs lots of help Many developers only think about helping by writing \ncode and becoming a committer of the project But open source projects need help with everything \nfrom creating documentation to translating the project into multiple languages to supporting users \nand other developers There are a lot of opportunities to help promote the project understand user \nneeds maintain old versions prepare for the future and much more What well be discussing in this \nchapter is exactly what the value is and how you can start contributing to open source projects today\nAccess to amazing software\nFirst and foremost open source software  gives you access to amazing software The value of having \nsource code access to a piece of software that solves a problem that you have and that can also be \nadapted to your specific situation cannot be overstated Being able to incorporate code that is ready \ntested and working in the real world into your own projects personal or commercial is a huge value \nIt is so valuable that most companies will charge you a premium to have access to similar code And \nyou get it for free Thats the reason why its very rare to find any projects today that build all they need \nfrom scratch and do not use some preexisting open source software\nEven if youre just using the libraries of your preferred language youve probably used a lot of prebuilt \nopen source components since most programming languages  today are open source\nAccess to knowledge\nHaving the source code available  allows you to study the workings of the software This is extremely \nvaluable Y ou can learn a specific piece of code or how a project works But even more interesting \nyou can learn the best practices Lets say for example that you have a specific problem to solve such \nas how to generate good logging create scalable software or maybe how to develop a secure login \nprocess By looking at open source software that already implements any of that you can learn how \nother developers solve this particular problem that you have\nTo build on one of those examples we are sure you have used the logs from an application server or \na web server to debug and identify problems So you have confidence in how useful the logging of \nlets say Tomcat is If you can access the source code of Tomcat and learn how that team created it \nyou can implement the same thing in your software\nLearning\nY ou will learn by looking  at the source code following the work of more experienced developers \nlearning their processes automation scripts and even runtime configurations and understanding \nhow the team interacts how they handle conflicts and what happens when someone quits or doesnt \ndeliver their part There is so much you can learn from open source projects There is no better way \nto improve your development skillsBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 178\nImprove your skills as a software developer\nFor you to improve  your software developer skills you need to practice But it is more than that Force \nyourself to practice slightly beyond your current skill level Participating in and contributing to open \nsource projects will give you development skills in all areas that you can imagine\nNot only are there all kinds of open source projects in different technologies and programming \nlanguages using a myriad of architectures and solving wildly different problems but also in any open \nsource project you have the whole of the development life cycle implemented  from understanding \nusers needs to developing software collaboratively in a team debugging and testing packaging the \nsoftware all the way to delivery and maintenance Participating in open source projects will give you \nall the skills needed as a software developer which brings us to impact\nImpact\nA counterargument is that you could learn  and build all those skills by participating in a project in \nyour company That is true to a certain point Open source projects have the added opportunity of \nworking on impactful projects Not every developer has access inside their company to implement \nsoftware that will be used by a large number of people software that provides value to society or any \nother impact that you might want to have\nBecause there are many open source projects out there you can always find a project that matches \nand connects with your objectives and the impact that you want to have which brings us to purpose\nOpen source projects can give you a greater sense of purpose\nPsychologists indicate  that our sense of purpose is normally associated with helping others By \nworking on open source projects that other people are benefiting from you participate in this giving \necosystem Friends are not only people that we have fun with but also people that we work with on \npurposeful things\nWhen you participate in an open source project you are building something significant together \nwith many other developers The longer you do this the more you know who they are and how they \nwork and understand their code Y ou meet them at events and have meetings and discussions over \nemail and online All of these build close bonds between the team After all although you work at \ndifferent companies and may even live in different countries youre all working on the same project\nQuite frequently the friendship acquired from an open source project spills into the lives of the \ndevelopers Members meet each other at events go out for dinner and may even visit each others \nhouses Open source participation can expand your contacts and networking to a much larger array \nof people  and not only developers by the way In any open source project there are also designers \ntesters writers and managers from different companies and backgrounds Y ou have access to all \nthose people which will give you much better access to knowledge a different set of skills and even \nto companies  and job opportunitiesSelecting an open source project\n 179\nNetworking\nNetworking inside an open source project  is of high quality exactly because it is around a common \ngoal A special type of networking that also happens is having access to developers that are more \nexperienced There is a widely known principle  in management called Joys law attributed to Sun \nMicrosystems cofounder and coauthor of the Java specification Bill Joy Joys law states that no \nmatter who you are most of the smartest people work for someone else\nThe principle is based on the idea that the outside of your company is much larger than the inside \nWhat is a good way to meet interact and work with people outside of your company Open source \nproject participation is a darn good one\nFor you to have access to the top smartest developers in the world participate in open source projects \nthat they are already involved in Because software development has a big component of arts and \ncraftsmanship working with developers that are better than you is the best way for you to improve \nyour skills\nPortfolio\nOne of the best ways  to showcase your skills is by mentioning a project that you participate in and \nthe company and people that you work with Open source projects can facilitate you having a strong \nportfolio of interesting problems projects people and companies that you have worked with\nOne of the best features of open source software is that it is visible and public This is great for you to \nlearn from it but it is also perfect to showcase your work Y our contributions are visible on the project \nsite but also in open source repositories such as GitHub and Bitbucket Developers even use those \nvisible contributions as part of and sometimes as their main curriculum Most companies looking \nfor developers will consider your visible contributions as proof of work that youve done and as a way \nto evaluate your experience\nWith all of that participating in open source projects helps you build a strong reputation as a professional \ndeveloper Y ou are showing your experience Y ou are working alongside great developers Y our code \nis publicly visible showcasing your experience and skills It helps you build those skills to begin with \nThere is a lot of value in participating in the open source community and open source projects Now \nthe biggest question developers usually  ask is how do I find a project to be part of\nSelecting an open source project\nAlthough there are millions of open source  projects not all of them will be suited for you and your goals \nso here are a few things to consider in selecting open source projects you may want to participate in\n Work on projects that are related to what you know\n Work on projects your company uses and depends on\n Work on projects you are interested inBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 180\n Participate in a foundation Apache Eclipse Linux etc\n Work on projects your friends are part of\n Start your own project\nProjects you are already using\nA good place to start your open source participation is on projects that you are already using Y oure \nprobably using programming languages libraries and tools that are open source already Do any of \nthose interest you Do you see things that you would like to change or improvements you d like to \nmake Starting with a tool or library that you are using will make it much easier for you to look at the \nsource code understand how it works and even propose improvements or changes\nSince you are already using those libraries you may even have the source code in your artifact repository \nand ready to load into your IDE or debugger Depending on your stack and build process you may \nalready be building the source code along with your own source This makes it very easy for you to \ninspect the source debug a problem and get started with the open source part\nProjects your company uses and depends on\nIt can be even more rewarding  if there are open source projects libraries or tools that your company \nuses today and maybe even depends on to go deep into those projects Being knowledgeable about \nand even participating in open source projects that your company depends on may allow you to \nwork on open source projects during your work hours Eventually you could put yourself in the very \ninteresting position of being paid to work on open source projects\nUsing this strategy many of the top open source developers in the world are paid to work on their own \nprojects Because they work on them full time they are much more effective and able to contribute \na lot more Remember that the meritocracy has to do with who puts in more effort Being paid to \nwork on their own project makes a developer a stronger member of the community\nProjects that are related to what you know\nAnother way of choosing an open source project is by looking for projects that are related to something \nthat you know and are good at Its much easier to participate in projects where you are already familiar \nwith the technology\nIf you are a Java developer it is easier to participate in projects related to Java If youre particularly \ninterested in data or databases you might know the details of how a database is implemented and \nmay be interested in participating in open source database projects\nUsing whatever existing knowledge you have is a great way to get involved Y our knowledge might \nbe exactly what the open source project needs to implement a new feature or improve an existing \npiece of codeSelecting an open source project\n 181\nProjects you are interested in\nExpanding on this idea a little you can look for projects on things that you are very interested in and \nwould love to get more involved in beyond the technology realm\nLets say you like a sport such as surfing biking or soccer for instance Y ou could participate in the \nmyriad of open source projects related to sports This works for any interesting activity that you love \nY ou may be a lover of franchises such as Lord of the Rings  games such as Dungeons  Dragons or \ntoys such as LEGO Look for open source projects around those areas Y ou will be surprised by what \nexists out there\nIt also works beautifully for religious and spiritual interests There are open source projects focused on \nhelping people from all faiths and beliefs to deepen their spiritual lives This can also apply to software \nthat solves more mundane daytoday problems such as databases of members or streaming meetings\nBeing able to contribute  to things you enjoy and are part of using your soft development skills will \ngive you a sense of purpose connect you more with the community and get you to meet and interact \nwith people that share your interests\nProjects your friends are part of\nExactly because interest plays a big role in your willingness to participate and contribute if there are \nopen source projects that your friends are involved in or are using they might be very interesting for \nyou to participate in\nWorking with friends is more enjoyable and motivating Even more it is easier They already trust \nyou and know how interested and committed you will be It is also easier for you to ask questions and \nhave conversations This can even deepen your friendship\nParticipate in an open source foundation\nExtending that idea of working with friends another good place to look for projects is by getting \ninvolved with an open source foundation a user group or even a company that you would like to be \nconnected with\nMany companies have their own open source projects and if you are a fan of their work or would like \nto work for one of those companies you would do very well by looking at what open source projects \nthey are involved with the ones they sponsor or even the projects they run themselves\nIf you would prefer to contribute to the projects  of a specific company there are many open source \nfoundations that you could get close to the Apache Software Foundation the Eclipse Foundation the \nCloud Native Computing Foundation and the Linux Foundation among many others Not to forget \nOSI These are nonprofit organizations behind some of the top most used open source projects in \nthe world If you align with their goals and beliefs and how they work you would do very well in \nchoosing a project that they sponsorBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 182\nOne interesting result of working with a company or a foundation is that they usually have the whole \ncontribution process very clear documented and explained They also try to adopt the best practices \nof project organization Y ou do not have to guess how things work It is not uncommon that developers \nthat already understand the process end up participating in multiple projects of an organization \nbecause they are familiar with the process\nStart an open source project\nBesides all that anyone can start an open source project so you can always start by creating your \nown However while it gives you some visibility and builds your portfolio it is not the most \nrecommended strategy\nThis isnt because it doesnt work or is a bad idea in itself After all most open source projects if \nnot every software project started because someone at some point in some place decided to solve a \nproblem and started writing code But starting your own open source projects will not give you great \nvisibility or immediate access to other developers best practices or learning from others To gain all \nof that you will have to build other skills such as promoting your ideas and attracting developers to \nyour project These are great skills but are hard on themselves\nSo before you start or maybe during your own project it may be a good idea to practice by participating \nin a few other projects so you gain the skills and experience necessary\nThese tips will help you find an open source project that youre interested in participating in Y ou \nmight even find several that are interesting to you\nFinding projects is a good start but its just the beginning Now that you have a few projects in mind \nthe fun  begins Lets discuss how you can get accepted to an open source project\nBuilding trust and getting accepted\nOne of the biggest mistakes  developers make in trying to participate in open source projects is thinking \nthat an open  source project is just there for the taking Developers may think that just because the \nsource code is available anyone can just come in and do whatever they want with it That could not \nbe further from the truth\nAn active open source project is developed by a community of people that are very passionate about \ntheir code Y ou could imagine that their project is their little baby They take care of and protect it \nAlthough open source developers are particularly open and accepting they need to trust you before \nyou can actually contribute anything\nImagine if it was one of your projects and a random person that you have never seen before just comes \nin makes decisions changes your project direction or tells you what you should be doing next Y ou \nwould probably not be very happy Y ou would need them to start slowly make a few suggestions that \nyou would be glad to accept and in general follow your lead on where the project should go  at Building trust and getting accepted\n 183\nleast until you know who they are and you form a connection That is what building trust looks like \nand thats why when you approach an open source project you have to start small Building trust is \na process that can take some time\nDevelopers on open source projects want contributions but we all know that code maintenance is a \nlot harder and something we spend more time on than creating code to begin with Y ou will not be \nsurprised to hear that people come into a project suggest something and disappear That just leaves \nbehind lots of unruly code that will need to be maintained for a long time and this type of behavior \nis not very welcome\nThe first principle you should adhere to when you try to participate in any open source projects is to be \nhelpful That might seem easy Y ou know your stuff of course so anything you do will be helpful right\nThat is not how it works Being helpful does not mean being the smartest person or contributing the \nmost amount of code Being helpful means thinking about the current users and maintainers of the \nproject Help them to do what they are trying to do Help them solve problems instead of creating \nproblems for them\nTo illustrate that lets consider a concrete example We already mentioned that maintaining code is \nwhere most of the work on software happens If you plan to join an open source project and contribute \na lot of code to implement something that you think is important but you dont plan to stick around to \nmaintain that code you may be tempted to believe that you are being very helpful But in fact as you \nare creating code that needs to be maintained this ends up just leaving more work for the maintainers\nIt is for that reason that when you browse any open source project that has a bit of traction you will \nfind lots of pull requests which are basically proposals of changes many times with dozens of lines \nof code which instead of being incorporated into the project sit there untouched by the maintainers \nIm sure the developers that contributed those pull requests thought they were being helpful But in \nreality they were just leaving extra work for the maintainers They now have to analyze the submissions \nvalidate whether they really work as intended consider whether the changes are necessary or valid for \nthe project test whether they break compatibility incorporate the changes build tests around them \nand maintain the functionality for all future versions\nIf you are really serious about participating in and  contributing to open source you should approach \nprojects in a more helpful manner and consider them as a longerterm strategy Y ou will be much \nbetter received Let us now discuss in more detail some tips on being accepted to contribute to an \nopen source project \nBuild trust\nParticipating in open source projects is all  about trust This is similar to any project where you work \nwith others but open source projects need a higher level of trust In your company for example there \nis a hierarchy and your manager organizes things and directs the developers on what to do Y our \nmanager can tell you what to do because they have a level of power over you and your workBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 184\nIn an open source project things are more selfmanaged The developers work for different companies \nand most of the time there is no hierarchical relationship Even the leader of the project doesnt have \nthe power to tell you what to do The relationship is one of influence and trust Trust is not something \nthat you can just take Trust has to be earned\nStart small\nTo build trust you should start small Small contributions  are a great way for you to know more \nabout the project and the maintainers to know more about you Small contributions are easier to get \naccepted because they dont bring a lot of overhead\nTry to start with the smallest thing possible That will give you a better idea of how the project works \nhow things are organized and who is doing what\nStart by building the project running tests and making small changes for you to know where things \nare and how they work and where help may be needed Look for small things to contribute to Look \nfor little fixes or improvements in the documentation or noncritical areas such as tests and example \ncode Some projects even list easytofix issues that you could take a look at\nTest the waters Experiment with the process Get people to start knowing who you are and seeing \nthat you are serious about it\nJoin the mailing list\nAmong the small important things that you should  do is to join the mailing list and communication \nchannel Open source is a very distributed process so communication is paramount among the team \nEvery open source project has either an email list a Discord server a Slack channel or some other \nform of communication Thats where developers and users communicate and you should be part \nof that from the beginning Observe for a few days and understand who is who in the project Try to \nfigure out what is going on and how things work before trying to contribute or change things\nDont try to impose your own ideas\nListening and patience  are probably the most important skills when working in open source Although \nyou may have amazing ideas and an amazing vision of where the project could go listen first to \nunderstand where the project is actually going Committers and maintainers may have their own \nreasons why the roadmap is the way it is or why the priorities are what they are right now Its rude to \ntry to change things before you have an understanding of what that is and are accepted into the group\nInstead of coming up with amazing new ideas try to be helpful Find out the ideas that already need \nto be implemented and fixes that need to be done that you could start helping with immediatelyBuilding trust and getting accepted\n 185\nThink about the project users first\nThink about the project  users first after all the reason for an open source project is to help solve a \nproblem that someone has Even in very small projects that have just a handful of users or where the \nusers are the developers themselves the focus is still on the users Since the owners of projects are \nprobably thinking about the users you would do very well if you did the same\nA good way to put users first is to keep an eye on the main list or other user channels to see what \nproblems people are having Is it hard to get started Are there installation problems Is the tutorial \nnot very helpful These could be good places for you to volunteer to help\nThe more you understand the needs of the users the more helpful you are going to be to the project \nand the maintainers\nStart with things where you do not need permission\nOpen source code can be  analyzed copied modified and distributed without having to ask anyones \npermission but to become one of the committers and be able to modify the project itself you do need \npermission Until the day you become a committer you are probably going to need approval reviews \nand some handholding Some projects even require a sponsor to vouch for you and work with you \nin every contribution you make Before you get that kind of access to the project you can help with \nthings that do not require any permission\nExamples of things that do not require permission are answering questions in the mailing list or helping \nbeginners to get started using the project Y ou can help both users and developers of the project to \ndo things they are trying to accomplish by researching and clarifying how things work Y ou can write \narticles or even present about the project These are some of the many helpful things that you can do \nthat do not require permission from anyone\nLet us take a look at two particular things that do not require permission and that are extremely \nhelpful promoting the project and answering questions\nPromoting the project\nOne of the most important things that you can do that does not require any permission is to promote \nthe project Every open source project needs to be seen  it needs to be visible and used by many \npeople Any promotion that you can do of the project is helpful for the project and for you\nWhile you are studying and understanding the project write articles and create social media posts \nDiscuss the project on Facebook write articles on LinkedIn create tutorials put stepbystep instructions \ntogether including screen captures and teach classes on Y ouTube Whatever you would like to see as \na resource to help you use the project create that for others Y ou can do that even if those resources \nalready exist and you believe you can bring a new angle or approach to help someone elseBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 186\nY ou can start by promoting the project inside your own company or at your school The more people \nthat know and use the project the more valuable the project is and since you are associating yourself \nwith it the more valuable you will become too\nAnswering questions\nAnother place where you do not need permission is to answer questions Y ou might think that as a \nbeginner in the project you do not know as much as others But you are here for the long run The \nmore you look into the source code and understand the project the more youll be able to install \nuse and configure the project It will be easy for you to find beginner questions that you can answer\nAnswering questions on the mailing list forums and blogs will help the project be easier to use \nand attract more people It is a feedback loop because you will know more about the project When \nanswering a question you might need to look at the source code understand a piece of the project \nor learn a commandline option That research will help you understand the project better and will \nmake you a more useful contributor when the time comes\nMoving on to help more closely\nIt will then become time to start  moving on to help more closely For any contribution to be accepted \nyou will initially need to get some kind of approval Here is where you will need to understand how \nyour chosen project works\nHow are contributions accepted What are the specific policies How do you submit your contributions \nAre there any legal documents or agreements that you have to sign What other process should you be \naware of Different projects have different policies and larger communities will have more processes \nthan small ones Also companies and foundations will have specific requirements\nThat is one more advantage of starting small Even larger more bureaucratic projects have simpler \nprocesses to accept small contributions Things such as documentation changes misspelled words \ncorrections and even small code fixes are usually allowed without complicated agreements\nLarger contributions even if it is just adding a test to the project may trigger a more formal relationship \nsuch as signing a contributor agreement or other legal documents for the particular project Companies \nand nonprofit foundations are usually more aware of those processes and have clear documentation \nfor getting them done In smaller or less formal projects those things may be nonexistent or just \nnot very clear\nImprove the documentation\nDocumentation  is usually the point of entry for newbies in most projects Having good documentation \nthat is consistent with the latest version of the project is very important for the success of the project\nY ou can start by closely following introductory documentation such as a tutorial or a README file \nand see whether it works follows the latest version and is clear to someone that has never used the Building trust and getting accepted\n 187\nproject before If you find problems nonclear parts or commands that dont work you can submit \na pull request to have the documentation fixed\nEven a single misspelled word which may not seem like much to worry about is a good place to \nstart Maintainers will gladly accept corrections like this and it will be easier for them to approve your \ncontribution than to reject it That is a great step toward building trust and starting  to participate in \nthe project\nImprove testing and project delivery\nAnother thing  that you can do is to improve testing There  is no such thing as too many tests in any \nproject Y ou could start by looking at the existing tests and try to see whether you can improve or \nadd new tests to the project\nSee whether you can help with project delivery Help automate things such as packaging running \ntests or automating the development environment Y ou can also work on creating Docker images \nsetting up CICD pipelines handling backups site infrastructure or a myriad of other automation \nand configuration work that is not the main goal of the project and that in many projects no one is \nreally responsible for or willing to take care of\nHelp with upgrades\nEvery project needs help with upgrading  things  be it the libraries the project depends on the version \nof the language that is being used or the tools that the project uses Y ou can run the project on a \nnew version of the runtime switch the version of the library being used and identify the problems \nSometimes this is easily accomplished just by running the build and tests\nY ou can also see where the project may be using outdated or deprecated libraries or methods and \nwork to upgrade those to more recommended versions Also if security issues have been found in \nlibraries it may require the usage of a new version or applying a fix to the project Sometimes if you \ncan just make the assessment this is enough to rally people to fix things\nSome languages and runtimes come up with major improvements from time to time For example \nthere is a new version of the Java runtime every six months sometimes with significant language or \nlibrary improvements It is similar to when a new version of Perl or Python comes up In those cases \nthere may be a need to change the code call better versions of the API or use a faster more secure \nversion of the API\nIn large projects those might represent hundreds of places where those things should be fixed In \nmany cases some of those fixes are simple and can be automated by your IDE Y ou may think that \nthis is easy because of that but fixing them and testing and creating the pull requests are all time\nconsuming steps that could totally be done by a newcomer in the project that doesnt have a lot of \nother responsibilities Thats where you can suddenly become very useful to the projectBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 188\nOne condition for large things such as this  is to make sure that the team is considering such a move \nor at least is open to it Y ou can then volunteer to be the person to do it\nFix small issues\nEvery project has small things  to be fixed that no one has the time to do Some projects even create \nbeginners issues to help people see what they are capable of helping with and get started\nIf the projects that you are looking into have something like this take a look at the issues that exist \nand see whether you can fix one of them Y ou can learn the whole contribution process by doing this \nLook at previous small fixes that have been done by other people to see whether you could have come \nup with the solution yourself and how others have submitted solutions in the past\nDo things no one wants to do\nMany people that want to be part of an open source project do so because there is something in  \nparticular they want to work on Hopefully by now you can see that theres much more that goes \ninto open source projects Open source is valuable and can push your career forward really fast So \nit could help to approach it from a different angle than initially expected\nWhen you start thinking about what the users especially the maintainers of the project want you \nwill quickly find out as many things that they do not want to do These are things that have to be done \nwhere it would be good if someone did them but the committers are too busy to do them\nThat is why we suggest things such as documentation and testing because usually those are parts of \nthe projects that developers are least interested in working on Once you volunteer to do things that \nno one else wants to do you build for yourself an open space for you to work inside the project No \nmatter how small that space is it is enough to build trust with people in the project Y ou will more \nclearly see the value that youre bringing to the project and they will want you to do more\nDo not be afraid of doing those things thinking that you are going to get stuck doing them forever \nbecause that is not how it works As we discussed before open source projects are based on meritocracy \nwhich does not mean that the best person has merit but all of the people that do things do The more \nthings you do the more responsibilities you will have in the project\nTo summarize the preceding there are five steps to successful participation in open source\n1 Select a project  pick a project that is of interest to you\n2 Communicate with the leaders  it is a twoway street Share ideas before coding solutions\n3 Research the project  read the discussions and issue trackers and download the drafts\n4 Decide on action items together with the project leaders Remember to discuss ideas before \nsubmitting a pull request\n5 Contribute and share your actions on the mailing list issue tracker or repository for the  projectBuilding trust and getting accepted\n 189\nMaking open source a core part of your evolution\nOnce you understand  the value of open source have selected open source projects to participate in \nand have built trust to be accepted into those projects you are ready to incorporate open source as a \npart of your career evolution\nWhen the team accepts you take your responsibility seriously\nIts not uncommon  for developers to do some initial work on a project just to have something to put \non their resume or to secure a new job Once they get the results they were looking for they stop \nhelping and go do something else maybe enjoy their new job\nOn one hand there is nothing wrong with this Really There is no obligation or commitment in open \nsource Y ou are a volunteer and you work as much and for as long as you would like to Y ou are not \nforced to continue helping indefinitely however it takes effort from you and the project maintainers \nto get someone you up to speed and set up to contribute Y ou end up building a relationship with \nthe people and the users Y our code is there being maintained When you decide to contribute to and \ndive deep into a project take it seriously Work on projects in which you see value for your career in \nthe long term That way you can really put in the effort and keep working on it for enough time to \nmake a mark on the world\nBy making small contributions to open source projects you can gain valuable experience and make a \npositive impact without requiring a significant investment of time and effort from either yourself or \nthe project maintainers As you become more involved in a project and take on greater responsibility \nyou will also have the opportunity to build relationships and expand your professional network\nTaking this responsibility seriously can lead to significant benefits for your career Not only will you \nbe able to showcase your skills and contributions to potential employers but you will also be able to \ndemonstrate your commitment to open source and the value it can bring to your work Start small and \ngradually work your way deeper into projects that align with your goals and interests The friendships \nand connections you make along the way as well as the impact you have on the projects themselves \ncan be truly invaluable As we mentioned in other parts of the book there are five main skills needed \nto improve yourself and your developer career The cool thing about open source projects is that they \ncan help you with all of your development abilities\nThis is huge In the past if you wanted to have an opportunity to work on sophisticated projects built \nby a team of experienced developers and serving large numbers of users you needed to be  hired by \na company doing all of that Open source turns this on its head Y ou can now do all those things no \nmatter where you live or where you work Let us see how participating in open source can help you \nwith all five umbrella skillsBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 190\nReading code\nReading code  is a fundamental ability for software developers It is the basic skill that you need for \neverything in your developer career Knowing how to read code in different languages and versions \nwith increasing levels of difficulty and implement multiple patterns and architecture are critical to \nyour success as a developer and also your ability to contribute effectively to open source projects This \nskill  being able to read code  is the basis to help you achieve all the other skills\nAs the name implies the basic freedom that open source gives you is the freedom of reading the \nsource code Imagine what that means No matter what you are going through right now in your \ndevelopment regardless of the language library or development problem there is some piece of \nsource code somewhere that you can read\nThis skill will give you access to insights experience and art and craftsmanship It is going to help you \nunderstand the problem better and get clarity on the solutions There are open source projects that \napply every possible design pattern and use any architecture you can think of Reading open source \ncode will help you get a realworld deep understanding of software design\nThe following are some practical suggestions and a few things you can do to improve your \ncodereading abilities\nRead code from libraries\nThe easiest thing you can do related to open source is  to read code from the libraries that you use \nand that you call Any software development project that you are working on will use some open \nsource library whether it is the language that you use which has basic open source libraries some of \nthe libraries that your project is utilizing the framework you are basing your project on or the open \nsource infrastructure you are using such as application servers or databases From all of these you \ncan read and understand how the libraries work or how the frameworks youre using manage requests \nSpend some time every day reading the source code from the libraries that you use A simple thing to \nstart is to choose one library that youre currently using and open the source code just to take a look\nRead code you do not understand\nAlso try to read code you do not understand It is how you improve every skill  by pushing it a \nlittle above your current level The best way for you to improve your codereading abilities is to try \nto understand code that is not clear to you and that can be code in different programming languages \nthat you are less familiar with or code from more difficult parts of the frameworks that you are using \nRead code thats badly written or very confusing to understand Read code that solves a problem you \nare trying to solve All those exercises will make your codereading abilities a lot betterWriting code\n 191\nChange and step through the code\nAnother interesting activity that you can do is to make small modifications to the source code of an \nopen source project and see what results you get That may require a bit more than simply reading the \ncode Y ou may have to compile and build the project but it is going to help you have a much better \nunderstanding of how the code works While youre doing this you can spend some time stepping \nthrough the code on your debugger to  see what the code is doing This is also going to not only help \nyou with reading the code but also improve your debugging skills\nWriting code\nWriting code is the skill most  associated with software development It is no doubt the most visible \nresult of your work and the thing that most people associate with contributing to open source This \nmakes many developers imagine that to practice this skill you need to write code from scratch That \ncan work but it is not the best way Y ou also need to write code that you can compare with other code\nRefactor code\nTo really use open source  to improve your codewriting skills you can refactor code Y ou first use \nrefactoring to understand code better By breaking down its parts and understanding what each part \nis doing you will have a clear vision Y ou can then try to refactor the code to make it more readable \nmore efficient or cleaner When doing these exercises you probably will not even contribute the \nchanges back to the projects and just use them to improve your skills This will help you contribute \nto the project in the future since you will better understand how the code works and with that you \nwill also be able to solve problems Refactoring code even if temporarily just on your IDE is a great \nway for you to understand where the code is breaking before you can fix a problem or a bug\nUpdate and upgrade code\nWe already mentioned updating  and upgrading code and libraries This is a great codewriting exercise \nIt is something that every open source project needs at some point and many projects have even done \nfull rewrites to use new versions of the language or runtime Experiment on a project to find out what \nit would take for the code to be updated and especially what new versions of the libraries could bring \nto the project in terms of performance security and maintainability This can be a great contribution \nto the project and an amazing boost to your codewriting skills\nDelivering code\nAnother important  skill that you should have is delivering code Understanding the full life cycle of \nsoftware development will give you superpowers in our industry This is a very broad set of skills that \ntouches everything from understanding the problem to writing the code to testing and packaging It \nwill give you skills from delivering and deploying to running and monitoring not to mention things Build Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 192\nsuch as infrastructure as code zero downtime cloud deployments scaling containers and CICD \nY ou can practice most if not all of those skills by participating in open source projects Here are a \nfew suggestions that would be very helpful to any open source project and can give you practice and \nproven realworld experience in delivering code skills\nCode analysis  help with the project quality\nWe do understand that quality is an overloaded concept and can mean a lot of things to different \npeople But in terms of improving your skills any work you do to improve the quality of a project can \naid in your understanding of the development process\nA good place to start is with code analyzers This is because you can run them in the existing public \nsource code so you do not need any permission Y ou can just go and run them for your preferred open \nsource project Also those tools will analyze previous versions of the project that are available in the \ncode repository Y ou get an immediate view of how the code is evolving who is doing what where \nchanges are concentrated and what the hotspots of potential problems are A good tool to give you \nall this information is SonarQube which is itself an open source project As an added benefit those \ntools can flag many potential security issues That can be another area of focus if you are interested \nin security Tools such as SonarQube are very helpful especially for projects that aim to be used in \nlarge software projects If you are interested in a project that does not run code analysis maybe you \ncould volunteer to start an initiative like that\nTesting testing testing\nOK you may be tired of seeing testing being mentioned here I want to be a coder not a tester  we \ncan almost hear you thinking The thing is that testing is a differentiation skill Developers that are \ntestconscious and understand the implications the tradeoff and the value of quality have a higher \nvalue in the market Once a Java virtual machine engineer talking about the skills needed for a \nposition said We can teach Java to people that join the team but getting them to think about testing \nis much harder \nIf you do not have these differentiated skills right now it can easily be changed by helping some open \nsource projects solve their testing issues That is another helpful thing about testing every project has \na testing issue This could be running automating or writing tests to fix issues that show up This can \nbe an open door for you to enter and start helping\nGoing a little deeper and cranking up your skills to high gear some projects and technologies will \neven have strong testing requirements For example in the Java ecosystem any open source project  \nimplementing a Java specification has to run the Test Compatibility Kit  TCK  to provide a compliant \nimplementation Helping with these efforts could be extremely fruitful for the project and youSolving problems\n 193\nPackage and deliver the project\nThere are way more people using an open source project than developing it There are projects such as \nOpenSSH a project that is used basically on every computer system in the world and at one point was \nbeing developed by a handful of developers Because of that the process of delivering a new version \nand getting it easily into the hands of users is a crucial part of the project This includes things such \nas packaging it as a Docker container making it ready to use in a repository such as Maven Central \nor making sure it is easy to install\nIf the project already has those processes you can participate and help with the initiative If not \nimplementing and automating these efforts can make the project a lot more professional and easily \nusable by many more people A couple of other suggestions are packaging and distributing the project \nThis is something that can be done without requiring a lot of permission from the maintainers and \ncan be easily promoted to users and maybe later incorporated into the project\nSolving problems\nThis brings us to the next big skill and probably  the most important skill as a software developer \nsolving problems No doubt that open source projects focus on solving problems so being part of an \nopen source project will help you improve that skill but here are a few things you can do to make it \neven more effective\nUse the project in your current position\nThe first thing you can do is to use the open source project Find ways you can use the project in \nyour daily job Use it as a way to solve problems in your company and your current projects This is \njust the obvious Of course you can fix problems in the open source project itself To be amazing at \nsolving problems you need to be an expert in identifying the correct problem and understanding \nwhat is going on Every open source project has complaints from users where the details are unclear \nor the user was not able to articulate the issue When it is not clear to anyone in the development team \nwhat the problem actually is it cannot be fixed Y ou could be the person that identifies issues on the \nprojects mailing list or forum and then digs deep to identify exactly what is going on and what the \nreal problem is Doing that will make you amazing at getting clarity and solving problems Even if \nyou cannot go and fix it because you do not have permission or maybe you do not know how to fix \nit just understanding the problem is half of the battle\nY ou should also go deep into problems in the open source software that you are using If something \nis not working open the source code and try to find out what is wrong Maybe it is just that you \nmisunderstood what the library was doing it is a problem with the documentation or it is a bad \nimplementation or a corner case Who knows Y ou can find out Solving problems is about creativity \nso be creative Apply solutions found in open source projects to your current project Y ou may not \neven be contributing to a project but you can get inspiration from it and apply the same solutions to \nfix problems in your project or companyBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 194\nSharing  bringing value to your company and customers\nThe last umbrella skill that we are going  to discuss here is sharing Sharing what you learn is an amazing \nway to deepen your understanding and improve your learning process It is also a fantastic way to \nbuild your professional reputation We even have several chapters about different ways of sharing in \nthis book Using open source is a great way to improve your sharing skills so here are some ideas \nthat you can implement\nShare what you learn by working in open source\nStart by sharing what youve learned from everything else that weve talked about in this chapter \nWhen you read the source code of a project or you write something fix a bug or solve a problem \nyou will learn things Y ou should then share what you have learned even if it is something small The \nknowledge you acquired is very important but just as important is that people see that you learned \nthat from the project It promotes you and the project Sharing what you learned helps you get a deeper \nclarity and understanding of the project It will also attract people to use and even participate in the \nproject Another advantage of sharing what you learn is that you inspire people to participate in this \nor other projects and you spread the idea that being part of an open source project is a good way for \nthem to also improve their careers Everyone wins\nShare the project\nAnother easy and important thing you can do is to share the  project itself After all you probably \nbecame interested in the project in the first place because it solves some interesting problems that you \nhave or had Maybe the project helped your company achieve better results or solve a customer issue \nSharing all the things that the project has done for you or your company will really help the project \nto be more visible It will also help you have clarity on how to explain things to people and how to \nshare the pros and cons of something Last but not least sharing the project with someone will help \nthem solve their problems\nThe big advantage of sharing the project is that you will have a lot of information about it available \nfrom README instructions to tutorials examples and even the source code It is a lot easier to share \nsomething when the materials are already available for you to draw from That is a win for everyone \n for the project you and the people that are having problems\nShare the principles\nY our chosen project does something well does it not I can imagine that you were attracted to it because \nit has some technically interesting challenges or solutions Maybe it has a strong architecture uses a \nnew programming language applies some technology in an interesting innovative way or uses some \nnew idea or tech How about sharing those principles so people can use them in their own projects \nY ou can focus on large principles or even some small implementation trick or pattern the way the \nproject uses its data or even some secrets about the language that the project is being developed inSharing  bringing value to your company and customers\n 195\nThis is the secret you can do all of that even if youre not part of the project Y ou can learn principles \nby reading the source code and running the project and then share what you learned with other \npeople Sharing about the project is something that you do not need to ask permission from anyone \nfor It is once more a win for everyone involved It is a win for you because you get more visibility and \nimprove your reputation It is a win for the project because more people see the value that they are \ncreating the results of the project and the novel methods that they are using It is also very important \nfor the people that will be reading or watching your content because they can understand and apply \nthe same principles to their projects\nShare how to participate\nThe last suggestion for you is to share how to participate in open source After all you are doing the \nwork of getting involved of being accepted and contributing Y ou can then help other people to do the \nsame Y ou already know your project and know where and how to get started Y ou can help or even \nmentor new people in your project Or you can apply the strategies weve mentioned here in this book \nand share how they worked for you so other developers can work their way into their project of choice\nSharing is a winwin proposition for everyone involved so anything that you can share about your \ncurrent project and what youre doing or about participating in open source in general is extremely \nhelpful for you and everyone involved\nThe following are examples of bringing value to your company and customers\n Solve problems faster by adopting open source solutions\n Bring improved solutions to open source communities\n Build a knowledge base of solutions for your company\n Combine open source software for a more complete solution\n Build on top of existing open source projects\n Learn from solutions and patterns implemented in existing projects\n Apply proven open source processes inside your company or for your customers\nBringing value to your company and customers is key Working on open source projects can be \nextremely interesting and unbelievably valuable because it builds your reputation your knowledge \nand your skills Sometimes we forget that open source also brings amazing results for your company \nand customers Once you realize that this happens then you can start working on open source in \nyour current job That is interesting because as we said at the beginning of this chapter many open \nsource developers get paid to work on open source projects and the way they do that is by bringing \nclear value to their company and customers\nThere are a few things that you can look for and do to make sure that the open source product you \nparticipate in is bringing value to your company and customers Y ou can solve problems faster by Build Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 196\nadopting open source solutions Often companies spend substantial amounts to build frameworks \nand libraries and solve problems If you can find an open source project or even a small part of an \nopen source project that can solve the problem that you are trying to solve or that you can use as a \nbasis for something that you are trying to solve then it accelerates your projects and accelerates the \nresults of your company\nY ou can do the same thing by expanding that and combining multiple open source software projects \nto build a more complex solution for your company Instead of just looking at one project or a small \npart of a project what if you could combine a few open source projects that would solve 5080 of \nthe problems that you are trying to solve That could be an amazing result for your company Y ou \ncan bring a product to life much faster Y ou can get results and even your first customers by building \non top of something that already exists\nSometimes there are open source projects that are either infrastructure projects or baselevel initiatives \nthat you can build on top of Even complete projects can be improved upon or they can be used as \na basis and then modified Y ou can create a completely different new product or you can repurpose \na project An open source project can be used in different industries in diverse ways Building your \nsoftware solution on top of an open source project can help you achieve results faster\nEvery time you do that invariably you will end up improving the open source project itself Every time \nyou make a point of bringing back the improvements that you created to open source communities \nthat is one of the major ways that open source grows and becomes more prevalent and more important \nfor everyone People that are using open source software and building on top of it bring those \nimprovements back into the wider community Many people confuse that with giving away your \nproduct to the open source community Most of the time you are going to be using an open source \nproduct as a base and that is something that is completely different from what the open source project \ndoes Y our improvements on the open source base can be brought back to the community even if you \ndo not want to share the exact product that you are creating\nY ou can also use your knowledge of multiple open source projects that exist or your visibility of what \nthe projects are doing and how they work to build a knowledge base of solutions for your company \nOne of the most advanced things that you can do to really bring lots of impact for a company is to \ncontribute standard architectures They can be reused throughout all your company projects So if \nyou make the effort to map and define the open source projects that your company is going to be \nbased on and how the company can benefit these communities in return and you help the company \nforge a relationship with the open source project that you will be dependent upon that is going to be \nextremely helpful Another thing that can be helpful for your company is when your company has \nproblems such as performance problems compatibility problems or difficulties with their software \nsolution to learn from open source projects and how they solved similar problems Their solutions \ncan be reimplemented in your companys project That allows you to build on top of and learn from \nthe many hours top developers spent solving those problems and utilize their solutions in your current \nprojects By doing this you also build the knowledge that you need to bring improvements to those \nprojects themselves Y ou and your company win and the open source project winsDelivering value to your company and customers\n 197\nThe last thing that well mention here in terms of how you can bring value to your company and \ncustomers is when you apply proven open source processes inside your company to help your customers \nOpen source projects especially the larger ones are built with many developers that work for multiple \ncompanies sometimes spread out in large geographical areas using quite different communication \nstyles What happens inside of a company with requirements in terms of maintainability in evolving the \nprojects in a way that does not cause disruption to the large number of users who are using this project \nMost companies do not have the level of requirements in terms of usage and widespread adoption that \nsome open source projects have To learn how those projects evolved how they build their systems and \nhow they actually work you must incorporate software development best practices into the project \nY ou can help your company implement best practices That is valuable because that is a skillset that \nis difficult to teach people and it is much easier to learn it by participating in a project like this So \nonce you understand something by participating in an open source project then you can repeat the \nsame thing inside your company Thus you are helping your company to become more sophisticated \nand professional These soft development skills will really benefit your companys projects and every \nsingle customer that you have If you are a consultant or you do development work for customers you \ncan also apply the same  strategies with your customers benefitting everyone around you\nDelivering value to your company and customers\nParticipating in open source projects can be extremely interesting and valuable for your career because \nit helps so much with building your reputation knowledge and skills Y ou should not forget that open \nsource also brings amazing results for your company and customers Once you are able to start doing \nthis you can start working on open source in your current job As we said at the beginning of this \nchapter many open source developers get paid to work on open source projects The secret to doing \nthat is bringing clear value to companies and customers Next we will explore a few things that you \ncan do to make sure that the open source project you participate in brings value to your company \nand customers\nSolve problems faster by adopting open source solutions\nA lot of times companies spend huge effort building frameworks and libraries and solving particular \nproblems Y ou can try to find an open source project or even a small part of an open source project that \ncan solve the problem that you are trying to solve Y ou can also use one as the basis to do something \nthat you are trying to solve This usually accelerates projects and the results of the company\nCombine open source software for a more complete solution\nExpand that idea and combine multiple open source pieces of software to build a more complex \nsolution for your company Instead of just looking at one project or a small part of a project what if \nyou could combine 3 or 4 open source projects What if by doing that it would solve 60 or maybe \n80 of the problem that youre trying to solveBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 198\nThat can provide amazing acceleration for your company and you can bring a product or feature to \nlife much faster\nBuild on top of existing open source projects\nY ou can use open source projects and frameworks to build almost anything you want There are a lot \nof projects that are either infrastructure projects or baselevel initiatives or platforms that you can \nbuild on top of There are even complete projects that are maybe focused on something else but can \nbe used as a whole or in part and modified to suit your needs Y ou can create a completely different \nnew product repurpose it for another industry or use it in different ways Y ou get a base that has been \ndeveloped tested and is ready to be reused making your work much easier\nBring back improved solutions to open source communities\nEvery time you do any of the previous things invariably you will end up improving the open source \nproject itself Make a point of bringing back the improvements that you created to the open source \ncommunity That is one of the major ways that open source grows and becomes more prevalent and \nmore important for everyone\nY ou should not confuse that with giving away all your products to the open source community because \nthat is not a necessity Most of the time youre going to be using an open source project to create a \nproduct that is different from what the project does Y our improvements to the core of the project can \nbe brought back to the community even if you dont make public the exact product that youre creating\nBuild a knowledge base of solutions for your company\nY ou should also use your knowledge of multiple open source projects that exist and your visibility \nof what the projects are doing and how theyre working to build a knowledge base of solutions for \nyour company\nAfter all one of the most advanced things that you can do to really have a big impact on a company \nis to contribute to company standards and architecture decisions Once you help build those theyre \ngoing to be reused throughout all your company projects\nIf you make the  effort to map and define what the open source projects that your company is going to \nbe basing its projects on are and how the company can return value to the open source community \nyou are not only helping the company to forge a relationship with the open source project that you \nuse and depend on but you are also defining the architecture and frameworks that all the developers \nof the company will work with and how to use all that software togetherDelivering value to your company and customers\n 199\nLearn from solutions and patterns implemented in existing \nprojects\nAnother thing that can be very helpful for your company is to use open source to help deal with \nlarge complex problems Examples could be performance compatibility integration and scalability \nproblems Whatever difficult problem exists in their solution you can find and learn from open source \nprojects and how they solve it\nY ou can then reimplement similar ideas in your companys project That builds on top of many hours \nof top developers solving those problems Not only can you learn from and utilize those solutions in \nyour current projects but you also build the knowledge that you need to bring improvements to those \nprojects Again you and your company win The open source projects win too\nApply proven open source processes inside your company or for \nyour customers\nThe last thing that we will mention here in terms of how you can bring value to your company and \ncustomers is when you apply the processes that open source uses to get highly distributed teams to \nbuild software together\nAfter all open source projects especially the larger ones are worked on by many developers that \nwork for multiple different companies sometimes spread out in large geographical areas and usually \nwith very different communication styles Many open source projects have requirements that only the \nlargest companies will ever have such as high maintainability and evolvability Not to mention the \nprojects need to grow without affecting the large number of users who are using it Most companies \nalso dont have the level of requirements in terms of usage and widespread adoption that some open \nsource projects have\nLearning and applying how those projects evolve how they build their systems and how those projects \nactually build software are best practices that can revolutionize the way your company builds software \ntoo Those processes are not easy to learn but you can learn how to do them by participating in open \nsource projects Once you understand how to do something you can repeat it inside your company\nMaking your company a more sophisticated and professional software development house will benefit \nyour companys projects and every single customer that you have\nY ou can apply the exact same best practices with your customers If you are a consultant or you develop \nfor customers applying the same strategies in working with your customers will promote even more \nprofessionalism to everyone around you\nIn short participating in open source communities and open source projects will help you hone your  \ntechnical skills and improve your career in many ways It is an effort that can bring benefits to you \nyour company your customers and the wider development communityBuild Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 200\nInterview\nJosh Juneau\nQ Welcome Josh Juneau Java Champion We are sharing career stories and talking about how \ndevelopers have advanced in their careers\nJosh you are someone whos well known in the community and has had great success in your career \nand the Java developer community Bruno and I want to hear from you about your career Tell us just \na little bit about you and your career and what youre doing now\nA Well first I really appreciate you having me Heather and Bruno Im very honored to be here\nI am an application developer by day I also am a database administrator thats my fulltime job But \nin my off time I work a lot in open source and I also do a lot of authoring articles books and so \nforth Thats where I spend most of my time I also do lots of podcasting  I have a couple of podcasts \nthat Im a regular on so I enjoy doing that as well\nQ Podcasting is fun and its a good platform to be heard and make an impact\nWhat is a story you can share that really made your career start to move in the direction that led you \nto this point\nA I did lots of work with Java and learned it on my own through tutorials which were great I was \ninterested in learning other languages on the JVM so I got into Jython because I was familiar with \nPython at the time I started to get involved in the mailing list and to speak with some of the developers \nand I asked what I could do to help contribute\nI started by contributing to the website  I totally redesigned the website for Jython Then I started to \nwork on the Django on Jython project  I was one of the leads on that I made a pretty good impact \nin that community starting off with Django\nFrom there they asked me to be the lead author of the Jython book I went ahead worked with Apress \nand got into authoring there That kickstarted my authoring career\nIt happened quickly and I enjoyed every minute of it because I enjoyed working with Jython and the \ncommunity Making those connections with others in the community was a big deal its very important\nQ Sometimes I hear developers say I want to get started I want to participate in open source  I \nthink thats a very common topic that people bring to us when we talk about careers and there is often \na desire but people dont know how to take that first step I think you touched on it a little bit when \nyou said you joined the mailing list What was it that motivated you to take that first step Can you \nexplain how you got initiated into the community and how it built organically from thereInterview\n 201\nA I started off by asking a few questions on the mailing lists because I had questions about the \ntechnology and then I began to interact with the members of the group They started to say Y ouve \ngot some good ideas Why dont you help And so thats exactly what I did I started to contribute \nback and just went on from there\nIf youve followed me at all out there you know Ive got a few books and thats something that I was \ninterested in continuing I worked with a couple of people in the publishing industry and had some \nideas and they liked my ideas so I continued to pitch new ideas and they continued to like them I \nwould write books about those ideas and getting that foot in the door really helped with that part of it\nThen to build upon that I knew lots of people from the conference space because I started to attend \nmeetups Java User Group sessions and conferences Y ou start to make connections with networking \nnot only meeting people online through the mailing list and through the different projects but also \nmeeting face to face which makes a big impact and is very important\nI was then asked to start writing articles so I began to do some book articles Then I got interested \nin other open source projects as well so I started to be introduced to even more projects I think just \nbeing a part of the community has got me into so many different areas Its really helped my career\nQ And it sounds like along the way youre expressing or verbalizing your thoughts and ideas and sharing \nyour intentions saying I want to write a book I have these ideas  and getting feedback from people\nA Indeed Y ou have to not be afraid to provide your feedback and input If you sit back and listen \nand dont ever speak up or provide any feedback nobody will hear I think its important that you get \ninvolved and communicate  dont be afraid to share your opinions\nQ I think some people think that their opinion isnt significant enough or they dont have enough \nexperience and they end up being reluctant Or on the other side they might just assume people know \nthey want to be an author or contribute to an open source project and so they just wait to be asked\nA Its really important to take those steps and go out to your JUG or to a conference if you can Y oull \nprobably see people walking around that you have met online or that youve seen elsewhere before \ndont be afraid to go out and introduce yourself because thats how these connections get started\nQ Dont you think that progressing in your career after a certain point is more of an art than science \nNot every recipe works for everyone For example some people may have last or equivalent experience \nboth to careers while youre stuck Have you ever had the feeling that people were growing and you \nwere stuck\nA It can be like that sometimes Y ou can feel intimidated by others moving ahead and advancing \nand feel like youre stuck But at that point you have to reach out and do some work to learn more Build Trust and Solve Problems with Open Source Projects 202\ntechnology or learn in more depth about the technology youre already working with Engage yourself \nand learn more so that you can produce more\nQ Josh theres one question I want to ask because I am asked this question a lot many developers \nwhen youre talking about participating in open source and contributing to podcasts will say But thats \nnot development Those are extra things  Do you think that doing those things makes you a better \ndeveloper People say  All I want to do is be a better developer I want to do it for a certain goal and \nso doing all of those other things would detract from the goal It seems to be a waste of time doing \npodcasts and writing books instead of becoming better at developing  How do you feel about that\nA I dont think its a waste of time at all I enjoy writing books and articles because it keeps me well \ninformed about whats coming up or whats new In order to write a book or an article you have to be \nvery knowledgeable about the subject Ive never written a book or an article where I didnt learn at least \none or two things because youre always going out learning more reaching out to the community and \nfinding out more information and thats one way to help further your development its very important\nAnother thing is that with podcasts one of my favorite times of the month is when I get together with \nmy friends and discuss Java and other things that I d like to talk about because I learn what theyve \nbeen up to whats new in their world and things Ive never even heard about Every time I record a \npodcast and every time I write an article or book Im furthering my development\nQ Can you share a little bit about the impact that you think youve made in your career as a result \nof being involved in these open source projects and as a result of the articles books and podcasts\nA The first big impact I had was with the redesign of the Jython website because that impacted the \nwhole community It rejuvenated the Jython language\nWith respect to the books and the articles I hope that people are enjoying the content and learning \nfrom what I have to offer I know one thing that has had a big impact is the mailing list Thats one of \nthe easiest things you can do get involved by providing feedback to the different communities out \nthere and giving insight using your perspective That definitely has a good impact because you can \nfurther those technologies\nQ And its impacted your career as well and benefited it\nA It has It helped me learn more Every time I do things I learn more and so it does have a big \nimpact on the future of my career\nQ How much time do you spend a week on open source projects versus work for your employer\nA Thats a good questionSummary\n 203\nIt changes every week Its never constant If I have more free time one week I may spend a few hours \non open source If I dont have any time there are some weeks that go by where I dont spend any \ntime on it It just depends\nThats one of the things about open source that I think is similar for everyone its one of those things \nwhere people will make a big impact when they have the time and its just natural that sometimes \nyou are busy with other activities or your fulltime job and you dont have as much time to commit \nto the open source project But you should still continue to stay engaged and then as time allows \nmake your contributions\nQ What was the impact of the open source community on your career\nA Its had a significant impact Even being here today at the event and talking with all of my fellow \ndevelopers and people in the community Ive learned new things about what people are doing Ill go \nout and research those different things and learn more and maybe Ill get more into those avenues \n and maybe not But its always good to engage with the community and work with others that are \ndoing similar things and dissimilar things Even if theyre doing something thats not similar to what \nI do  if somebodys working on a different tech that Im not familiar with  I still like to try and \nunderstand what theyre doing and why it might be something Im interested in looking further into \nThe community is very important as is paying back to other individuals and always communicating \nwith your peers\nSummary\nIn this chapter you learned about the value of open source contributions how to identify open source \nprojects that are relevant to your career the steps to get involved and start participating how to find the \ntime and resources to keep participating and how you can make open source contributions valuable \nfor your company and your career growth In the next chapter we will discuss how to incorporate \npublic speaking to have an impact on your career journey12\nScaling Trust through Public \nEngagement Speaking  \nand Blogs\nIn the last chapter we talked about contributing to open source projects to increase your skills and \nadvance your career Trust is one of the most important currencies for your career growth Y ou need \nit for both contributing to open source projects and for public speaking When people trust you you \nhave access to better positions and more interesting projects So far you have been building trust \nby working closely with people in communities and open source Now it is time to build trust at \nscale Public speaking and sharing allow you to do that and thats what this chapter is all about In \nthis chapter we will cover what public speaking really is how to overcome fear and anxiety how to \ngenerate and present your content and how to find where to start sharing\nTrust is one of the most important things in our careers When we have trust we can get amazing \njobs get offered better positions and gain more responsibility We can then work on more interesting \nthings When we have more responsibility we become more of a leader and get a better salary\nTrust and responsibility go hand in hand The more trust you have the more responsibility you can \nacquire Trust is hard to build It requires people to know you and see who you are and understand \nwhat ideas you have and how much knowledge you have about a particular topic It is extremely hard \nto trust someone that you do not believe has the requisite knowledge\nTrust has a lot to do with what people believe about you Reputation is precisely what people believe \nabout you So trust and reputation although not the same thing go hand in hand\nOne powerful method to establish trust at a large scale and build a strong reputation is through sharing \nThis can be achieved through various means such as expressing ideas through written content in blogs \nor delivering impactful presentations\nAlthough both writing and presentations involve sharing they differ significantly Writing generally \nconsists of a more solitary process allowing ample time to refine ideas and incorporate input from others  Scaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 206\nHowever since the act of writing occurs behind the scenes the final product is the only visible aspect \nthat others witness\nPublic speaking be it in a presentation or on an online seminar or video tends to be done face to \nface with others They are different formats but in terms of creating and defining the content and \nunderstanding what the audience needs they are similar This chapter deals with sharing ideas in \ngeneral speaking blogging and writing\nIn this chapter we will discuss the following topics\n What public speaking really is\n Listening public speaking for introverts\n Generating unlimited content ideas\n Building and presenting your content\n Finding the right places to share\nBefore we begin its important to acknowledge that sharing can be intimidating When you put your \ncontent and ideas out there you become visible to others People see and hear you read your writing \nand become aware of your presence This vulnerability can potentially invite criticism and judgment\nWhen you share your knowledge and ideas others have the opportunity to assess your expertise and \nevaluate your authenticity They can gauge your true understanding of a subject and scrutinize the \nvalidity of your statements It is natural to feel uneasy about being vulnerable and exposed in this \nway Sharing can indeed be a daunting prospect evoking fear and apprehension It is exactly because \nit is scary that it is so powerful Most people realize that it is hard that it is scary and so believe that \nthey would never be able to do it They think I would need to be a master to do it If you are doing it \nit must mean that you are an expert \nThis is especially true for public speaking People have such a deep fear of public speaking that it \nmakes public speaking an extremely effective way of building trust especially when done in person \nand even more so at big events where lots of people are watching This combination is also immensely \npowerful and it is something that we can use to grow our careers our visibility and our reputation\nLet us see how we can use this tool as a career and reputation booster because it is not as hard as it \nsounds It is scary for sure but not hard\nWhat is public speaking\nPublic speaking can be  thought of as a form of sharing via a conversation No matter whether you \nare talking to someone one to one in person or even over the phone be it in a meeting at your \ncompany with a few people in a room or at a big event with hundreds of people in a room  it is still \na conversationWhat is public speaking\n 207\nEven when you are recording a video or authoring an article sharing is always a conversation with a \nperson Even at an event where speakers are talking on a stage the best speakers look at each person \nin the audience The speaker talks and the other person responds by nodding their heads or smiling \nThey reply to you visibly or in their heads\nSharing is always a conversation That is true also for writing when you write youre talking to someone \nWhen you read a book there is always a conversation The author is talking to you and telling you \nwhat is going on answering the questions that are in your head\nWhen you see speaking and sharing as a conversation it makes a lot more sense and it is easier for \nyou to understand what to do and how to do it When you think of sharing as a conversation that has \nthe potential to help more people it is also easier to decide to start sharing yourself\nHeather has experience of learning to share when working with a professional coach on her leadership \nand communication skills The coach John Bates had worked with her many times on sharing her \nstories At one point he became frustrated and asked her Why are you being so stingy with yourself \nin your presentations You are sharing stories here with me now and you have the potential to help so \nmany more people by publicly sharing more of your stories   This encouraged a shift of mind toward \nthinking of helping others by sharing\nThere are many formats that you can use for sharing but they fall into three main categories text \naudio and video\nText is the most prominent format and the most popular Y ou can share text content through blogs \narticles and books Y ou can write posts for your blogs articles for magazines or websites and even \non social media Y ou can also share text through both traditional books and ebooks and over email\nAudio is another popular way of sharing Podcasts and audioonly conversations on Twitter Spaces are \na couple of examples of this Audio is a great format for sharing knowledge because lots of people like \nto listen to content on the go Y ou can listen to content in the car or while youre walking or cycling to \nwork or on the subway Its easy to download and have on your device to listen to any time you want \nand as a result audiobooks for example are very popular Audio allows you to have a conversation \nwith your audience interview other people or even host a multiparty conversation\nAnd the last way is sharing through video or visuals such as a presentation on Y ouTube or on a stage \nfor example where people can see you This could be in person at an event or at a meetup It can also \nbe transmitted to people watching it remotely It can also be recorded and then watched later as a fully \nonline video This combination of audio video and slides with text is a really strong combination that \nmany speakers use to present their content in all those formats\nIn all of these formats you have one person sharing their content with many people listening reading \nor watching Y ou can also have a few people interacting with each other to create content such as \ninterviews or panels where different people share their views and then others can watch and listenScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 208\nThe idea behind sharing is to transfer knowledge and experience so more people have access to it \nThats why we consider sharing a way for you to build trust at scale because once you have a piece of \ncontent that has been recorded or written then it can be accessed by many people\nEven in an event where theres no recording but tens hundreds maybe thousands of people participating \nyoure doing the same thing Y oure building trust at scale because everyone thats watching your \ncontent will see you as an expert on that content not because you necessarily know more than they \ndo but because youre willing to put the work into clarifying formatting and curating the content \nand presenting it in a way that helps people solve their problems get inspired and take action And \nthis is probably the most important thing about sharing you want people to take action\nSharing is not only about you speaking and creating content but also about that content helping \npeople to solve a problem to take a step forward in their careers in their projects and in tackling \ntheir problems And so once you share your knowledge other people can take action on what youre \nsharing and use your content to solve their problems Thats when the cycle becomes complete and \nthats the highest level of trust when people trust you enough to take action on your proposals based \non what youre teaching them\nThis action could take many forms going back to their companies and applying that technology or \nexperimenting with that new project that youve talked about or maybe integrating a specific technology \nor technique into their project All of these involve people taking action on what youre sharing\nSo in general public speaking and blogging are parts of this ecosystem where you learn and experiment \nwith something and so you become good at something Y ou are then able to clarify curate and explain \nthat knowledge to other people Then you can use text audio and video to share that knowledge\nOther people will then understand what youre doing and be inspired to apply the same techniques \nand ideas in their own lives Once they do what happens They start trusting you more because you \nare now a trusted advisor that helps them solve that particular problem\nThat is how we build trust at scale Those ideas distributed in text audio and video can really help you \nreach large numbers of people There are technical presentations with millions of viewers on Y ouTube \nfor example We dont have to aim for massive scale or widespread recognition to see success in our \ncareers Its not necessary to go big or go home  to achieve meaningful results and make progress in \nour professional lives\nWe need first to affect people that are close to us Even if all you are doing is writing or presenting \nyour knowledge to others inside your company such as writing a document explaining how to  apply \na given technology to your project and then a few developers read that document and take action on \nyour proposals then youre also influencing and becoming trustworthy inside your company Never \nmind hundreds of millions of views working inside your own company is enough to deliver you \nplenty of results in terms of your careerPublic speaking for introverts\n 209\nPublic speaking for introverts\nWhen it comes  to sharing particularly for introverts its understandable that there can be hurdles to \novercome For introverts and those who fear being in front of people engaging in conversations and \nsharing ideas can be challenging limiting their ability to share effectively\nWhile extroverted individuals often naturally feel more energized and comfortable being in front of \nothers its important to note that being an extrovert is not a prerequisite for sharing Both introverts \nand extroverts can benefit from a powerful technique listening Listening plays a crucial role in sharing \nbecause the essence of sharing is not solely about talking its about understanding and helping others \ntake action to overcome their challenges\nWould you believe that Heather is an introvert By employing her natural strengths of listening and \nher genuine desire to help others she was able to utilize public speaking to listen and help others She \nshifted the way she thought of public speaking and then built the skills to excel at public speaking In \nthe process it became one of her greatest skills\nAs an introvert you likely excel in listening since it comes more naturally to you By actively listening \nyou gain insights into your audiences problems difficulties and experiences This knowledge becomes \na valuable resource for creating relevant content that resonates with your audience Extroverts can \nalso employ this technique by actively listening to peoples concerns and challenges shared during \nsocial interactions or events\nHow does it work It can be applied in various situations such as oneonone conversations For \ninstance when a friend confides in you about their struggle with implementing the latest Java version \nactively listening and understanding their problem enables you to create content that addresses and \nsolves that specific issue By consistently creating valuable content that helps people overcome their \nobstacles you establish  your  reputation and gain visibility in your field\nContrary to common misconceptions you dont need to search for universal problems or cater to a \nwide audience to create valuable content Even if you address the challenges of just one person and \nprovide a solution chances are you are also helping others facing similar problems who may not have \nvoiced their concerns or sought assistance elsewhere\nBy solving real problems for individuals you exponentially increase your reputation and visibility \nregardless of whether you identify as an introvert or an extrovert The key to generating valuable \ncontent lies in listening Start small by listening to your own challenges and difficulties Look around \nyou and listen to the problems faced by friends colleagues or individuals in your network By asking \nquestions and actively listening you can identify their challenges and gain a deep understanding of \nhow you can help\nListening not only boosts your confidence but also allows you to explore solutions implemented by \nothers By understanding the actions they took to overcome their obstacles you expand your expertise \nand learn from their experiences enabling you to provide even better  problemsolving strategiesScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 210\nOnce you have listened to peoples difficulties problems and solutions you can create content that \ngenuinely helps others implement effective solutions and navigate their challenges more effectively\nGenerate content ideas\nOne of the hardest parts of sharing is to decide what kind of content on what topic youre going to \nshare Its easy to look around and see that for anything that you can imagine someone already shared \nsomething and so theres nothing that you can add This couldnt be further from the truth just because \nsomeone else has already discussed a topic you want to talk about doesnt mean you have nothing \nvaluable to add Y ou have your own experiences your own problems your own particular situation \nThis is one of the most powerful presentation topics especially but not exclusively for beginners  \nadding your personal experience to the presentation or content When youre applying a technology \nfor example you have a specific context inside your company that can lead to different problems down \nthe road and you have different environments different existing problems and different resources \nThe same solution that may prove incredibly valuable and useful for a large company with a sizable \nteam can be an illsuited and problematic choice for a startup with only a few developers\nDepending on the context the environment and the resource you have available to you there are \ndifferent solutions and different experiences will come from these So if youre looking for a topic to \nwrite on you can share your own experiences This also builds trust People will want to know how \nthat solution actually worked for you Did it make a difference Did it rock your results Did it shake \nup your project They want to see if they can relate to your experience and find a parallel with their \nown situation If they do then theyre like Hey this could be the answer to my problem too I can \ntotally handle those challenges just like you did   Thats why sharing your experience is a gamechanger \nY ou bring a unique perspective that can be a goldmine for others\nBut that said we understand that choosing the right content to share is hard So here are some ideas for \nyou to select and decide what content to share Y ou can use it to help create unique content  above all \nconsider sharing your personal experiences Every time you share something that is personal to you \nsomething that happened to you to your project or your company youre always adding a different \nperspective and creating content that is unique to you\nY ou can share your experience with a problem that you faced in the past or that you still face today \nY ou can discuss how that problem affects you how it affects your project how youre trying to solve \nit the experience that you had while solving it and what other problems your solution caused All \nof these could be important ways to add your own experience to your content Y ou can also share a \nsolution that you implemented or would like to implement Talk about how you would or did apply \nthe solution to your project the pros and cons and how you use that solution in your company now\nY ou can also share things that you learn If youre studying something share it with others so they \nhave an easier way of learning what youre learning right now Share your personal experience of \nlearning it tooGenerate content ideas\n 211\nAnother way is to share your thoughts on a popular topic Popular topics pop up all over the internet \nIt could be a new technology that comes along or a new version of an existing technology everyones \ntalking about It could be a particular situation that happened a company that had a problem or had \na good result or launched a new idea that everyone is commenting on It could be something from \noutside the technology world such as a sports event like the soccer World Cup or a prominent movie \nthats coming out that  your audience is interested in Maybe a new Star Wars series or a new version \nof The Lord of the Rings\nAll of these things are popular Y oure going to see many people talking about them Y our immediate \nthought might be that everyones already talking about it and there is nothing for you to add but its \nactually the other way around When lots of people are talking about it many people are interested \nso you have more people to be interested in your content\nWhen you have a trending topic like this there is the opportunity to share your perspective on it \nY ou can dive into why the World Cup matters to the tech world or explore the software development \nhappening around the latest blockbuster movie Y ou can discuss how youve implemented a trending \ntechnology in your own project\nWhile everyone is buzzing about the new Java version you can chime in with your experience using \nit in your current project Share the challenges benefits and problems you encountered Talk about \nhow it impacts your work For instance if everyone is talking about ChatGPT you can discuss how it \nwill impact your specific tasks and daily life illustrating its broader impact In all of these cases the \nkey is to make connections to the technology you want to discuss For example if you are a frontend \ndeveloper creating content for mobile devices you can talk about how ChatGPT will change the \ndesign of mobile applications  this is a different take than most people have Another example is if \nyoure implementing an API you could talk about how ChatGPT can help you task the APIs All of \nthese are ways for you to connect the popular topic that everyones talking about to something that \nyou are doing right now and that will make your content unique\nAnother great way to make your content unique is to share some situation you have in your life Even \nnormal daytoday things can become content Y ou had a discussion with your friends how might \nthat connect to technology How does that connect to a discussion that people might be having inside \na team Y ou had a special interaction with your pets How does that connect with something that \nyoure doing at work or with the technology your audience is working on\nThat may sound strange but its completely possible Maybe you saw the video of two dogs fighting \nthrough a gate and then the gate opens and they just stop fighting and start becoming friends Maybe \nyou can make a comparison with how developers discuss technology on social media and yell at each \nother but when they sit down to work on the same project they quickly see that they have the same \nproblem and collaborate to implement a solution\nY ou can always see situations in your daily life and try to apply those situations to things that are \nhappening in your projects Y ou can also create comparisons or metaphors for things that you said or \nexperienced in your life Maybe you watched a movie that contained a metaphor that can be applied \nto the Technology Award for example That is a great way to create and generate unique contentScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 212\nAnother thing you can do is remix content thats already out there What would that entail It could \nmean comparing different content So you could say here are two different developers talking about \ndifferent technologies Y ou can compare those two different technologies based on what they wrote\nY ou can curate content from others Y ou can provide the best content to solve a particular problem \nfor example curate an archive of the best articles on solving the refactoring of legacy code Thats \ngreat curated content\nY ou could also respond to or expand on existing content If someone suggests a solution you could \nrespond with what problems that suggestion might create or expand on how that solution could be \napplied to other situations\nIn all those cases you give your perspective on some piece of content that already exists Y ou can \namplify criticize agree or disagree with any kind of content that already exists and that helps you \ncreate unique content also\nY ou can also join forces with other content creators Y ou can run interviews panels and discussions \nto bring together the opinions of different people and what they think what challenges theyre going \nthrough and how they can solve those challenges Y ou can do this live with people or you can send \nquestions to other speakers and bloggers In the latter case you could watch someones presentation \nand send them a set of questions that they can respond to And with that youre both creating \ncontent together\nThats not an exhaustive list but should give you some ideas of how you can always create unique  \ncontent No matter how much content on particular topic already exists on the internet you can always \ncreate something thats new different and adds to and improves on what already exists\nFind the right place to share\nNow that you  know how to find the right types and topics of content you need to find the right place \nto share it\nThere are many places where you can share your content but the most important thing is to know \nwhere your audience is Every time you share content youre sharing to help someone take action \nsolve a problem and improve their lives Y our content is geared toward a special person We call this \nan avatar  a representative of the type of person that needs to hear listen or consume your content \nWherever you publish your content the right audience your avatar needs to be present because thats \nwhere theyre going to find your content and benefit from it\nIf youre writing text one of the most common places to share it is social media If you have an audience \non social media sharing content there can help you promote content thats published somewhere else \nor you can use social media to write content directly Places like LinkedIn and Facebook allow you to \nwrite and publish longform content Some other social media such as Twitter will only allow short\nform content but you can create multiple posts in a thread which allows somewhat longer contentFind the right place to share\n 213\nAnother avenue for sharing is through blogging platforms specifically designed for content creation \nand publication Platforms such as Devto which caters to developers or Mediumcom which has \na broader audience offer excellent opportunities for posting your content and reaching a wider \nreadership These platforms act as distribution channels ensuring that your content reaches a larger \naudience These are particularly useful if you want to write oneoff pieces or standalone articles Those \nplatforms will promote and distribute your content to lots of people even if you dont have your own \nspecial audience\nY ou can also use that technique to write articles for places such as Dzone or Foojay or even magazines \nlike Java Magazine These are great places where you can write longer formats and multiple pages \nof content Also many companies have their own places for articles  consider checking with yours\nAnd of course you can have your own site We talk about this one last because when you have your \nown site you have to build the audience yourself you have to attract people to read your content \nWith the other destinations for content that we mentioned so far in this chapter the platform or \ncompany will promote your content for you so its easier for you to reach more people Despite that \nhaving your own site is great because its a place where you can keep all your content together and \ncan attract the right audience that you want There are different tools you can use to run your site \nincluding WordPress or GitHub Pages and Jekyll Y ou can use different tools of your choice to publish \ncontent on your own site\nIf youre doing audio of course you can publish your audio on your own site And if you have a site \nwith your own blog and audience you can publish your audio content there But there are also several \nplatforms for podcasting Y ou can publish your content on places such as Spotify Apple and Google \nall of which offer strong podcast platforms that allow people to easily download and listen to your \ncontent There are many other platforms like that Y ou can choose what works for you\nA more recent trend thats very important and very useful for audio is audio discussion places Places \nsuch as Twitter Spaces Clubhouse and even Discord servers will allow you to do host these audioonly \ndiscussions with other people Discord is an interesting place because you already have an audience \non public Discord servers that you can join including servers for user groups or communities and \nyou can run audio discussions there\nAnd last but not least we have video presentations Thats the top level of sharing There are many \nplaces you can do these Y ou can start inside your own company presenting to your colleagues Y ou \ncan expand to more people inside your company Maybe your company has an auditorium or an online \nplace where you can present something if you want to do more public things\nAnother good place to get started is at universities or sometimes technical schools where you have \npeople that might be interested in your content Often students may not have lots of access to industry \nplayers so theyre going to be an easier audience that you can talk to Y ou can be more informal and \ncreate and present your content there For careerminded people there are places such as meetups \nand user group meetings We discussed user groups more extensively in an earlier chapterScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 214\nIf your audience is for example Java developers then looking for Java User Groups could be a great \nplace to start If its Python developers Python also has a strong community that does meetups and \nso you also go find them there Y ou can also participate in online events run on Zoom or other online \nevents platforms such as Hopin or Airmeet\nThese platforms allow you to run events yourself if you want but often theres someone else running \nthe event itself and you are invited to submit talks as a speaker so the event attracts an  audience \nY ou have online events like this but you can also have physical events Places such as DevOps the \nDevelopers Conference and many other events exist worldwide There is certainly an event near your \ncity in your country where you can submit talks and present\nWe have a whole chapter here in the book that talks about conferences events and calls for papers \nConferences are a great place for you to meet people and present your content As a reminder look \nfor conferences in your technical community of interest Y ou can ask people in your network for \nrecommendations of conferences to attend and share your content Y ou can also observe on your \nsocial media channels the conferences people in your network are attending\nSince were talking about presentations a great place to do these is video platforms such as Y ouTube \nor Rumble These are video platforms where you can create your content and distribute that content \nfor people to see Those platforms allow ads on your content to sponsor it but usually you do not have \nto pay If you want a little bit more control over advertising or sponsorship of your content there are \nother platforms such as Vmail where you pay to publish your content Whether you host your own \npodcast or audioonly content or appear as a guest on someone elses platform these are all good \nplaces to  share your content as well\nOrganizing building and presenting your content\nCreating content can be challenging especially  when it comes to the process itself Now that youve  \nlistened to peoples problems difficulties and challenges and you want to offer a solution the best \napproach is to envision a journey for your audience Consider where they currently stand and where \nthey aspire to be Then identify the specific steps they need to take to progress from their current \nsituation to their desired destination With these steps in mind you can create content that assists \nyour audience in navigating each stage of their journey\nThis approach of envisioning their journey helps you create valuable content by addressing the gap \nbetween your audiences current position and their desired outcome Y our content can fill that gap \nby providing a clear path and outlining the necessary steps they need to take to progress This can \nbe highly specific such as addressing a particular challenge like How to build a Docker image   By \noffering precise solutions to specific problems your content becomes even more relevant and useful \nto your audience\nThen you can provide specific steps accompanied by code examples and detailed instructions \nThis includes tasks such as installing a particular tool executing specific commands or adding code Finding the right places to get started and share\n 215\nsnippets On the other hand you can also create content with broader topics such as How to start \nan international career   While these topics may not have exact stepbystep instructions you can \nstill outline more general steps such as preparing a resume in English and researching companies of \ninterest In both cases you are guiding your audience through a journey explaining each step and \noutlining the necessary actions This approach works well for various content formats including \narticles blogs presentations and even podcasts It helps you effectively organize and structure your \ncontent while inspiring and motivating your audience to take the required steps towards their goals \nAnother way that you can do this is via a less structured process\nIf you invite someone to have a discussion with you and plan some items to discuss in advance these \ntopics can be a little less structured because different people can add information Y ou can make it very \ninteractive and involve your audience Y ou can let the audience ask questions and make comments so \nit becomes more interesting for them as now they can participate ask questions and get their specific \nproblem solved when they interact The best presentations are interactive where you listen to what \npeople need and adjust your content to help them with the specifics of their situations\nWhen you present your content you should present using an appropriate level and register of language \nfor your audience If youre talking to a more formal audience such as your team or your boss you \nmight decide to use more mental representations numbers and details Match your language and \ncontent to the needs of the audience If the setting is a technical event for example where people are \nmore informal you can also present in a more informal way If you go to a university maybe you want \nit to be more informal to allow you to connect with the students\nIt is always important to align your tone attire slides and voice with the specific audience youre \npresenting to However the most crucial aspect is the audience itself When you share your knowledge \nthe main objective is to benefit your audience By sharing your expertise you enhance your visibility \nreputation and gain trust from others But remember the focus should never be solely on youit \nshould always be on the audience and their needs People are attracted to your content because they \nwant to achieve or acquire something Y our content should provide a solution to their problems or help \nthem attain their desired career job or project goals Whether they aspire to be a junior developer or \na team leader your content should guide and inspire them to take action Therefore every time you \ncreate content or decide where to share it keep in mind the impact it will have on your audience and \nhow it aligns with their desires and aspirations\nFinding the right places to get started and share\nY ou should always be thinking about the audience that you are targeting your content at That way \nyour content will always match your audience Once you have that in mind you can then apply all the \nthings we talked about so far in this chapter  listening to your audiences problems understanding \ntheir situation and helping them tackle their challenges organizing your content the right way and \ngenerating content that will help them finding the places where they are so you can present your content \nto them helping your audience to achieve what they want and tailoring your tone and formality to \ninspire people to take action Once you do all of that what happensScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 216\nWhen your audience gets results they trust you When they trust you your reputation grows and \nyour visibility in the market increases That takes your career to a new level\nNow lets consider some myths about sharing that we can dispel right now\nYou need to be a master to share  No you do not To share great content you only need to be a step \nahead of the people that will consume your content If you just learned something new you can share \nit with people who dont know it yet Even if you are not a step ahead you can still share good content \nY ou can share the problems you are facing or difficulties you are going through Y ou can ask good \nquestions to people that know more than you There are all kinds of ways to share that do not require \nyou to be a master But the reality is the moment you start sharing people will see you as someone \nthat knows their topic That is both a responsibility and a benefit It helps your career because people \nare going to see you as someone that knows the topic But its also a responsibility as you need to be \none step ahead of your audience\nThe other myth is that you have to be an extrovert to share We discussed this earlier in this chapter  \nhow introverts because they are good at listening can use that ability to share content thats valuable \nfor people Y ou dont need to be an extrovert to share There are many ways that you can share that \ndont require you to show up in person such as audioonly  conversations so you dont have to show \nup on video or a podcast for example or by text Y ou dont actually have to talk to anyone if you \ndont want to you can still share good content\nAnother myth is that it takes too much time  In a way that is true Sharing does take time but it \ndoes not necessarily take too much time What takes the longest is diving deep into a topic so now \nyoure able to share it There are many ways that you can share that dont require a lot of preparation \nfor example being interviewed by someone where you generate content based on your experience \nwithout having any preparation or spending a lot of time writing things Answering questions from \npeople is another way that you can create content without a lot of prior preparation The biggest time \ncommitment involves deeply researching a topic so that you can actually create content about it That is \nmost likely what youre already doing in your career anyway Y ou are diving deep into things to do with \nyour projects to learn about technology The sharing part does not necessarily need to take very long\nAnother myth is that sharing is a waste of time because it does not improve your expertise  If youre \ngoing deep into a topic to apply it in a project for example youre building expertise When you then \ngo to share your knowledge with someone youll notice any gaps you mightve missed and things \nthat you dont actually understand very well That will allow you to become much better at something \nthat youre already interested in allowing you to solidify your knowledge by applying it and reflecting \non it The sharing part essentially involves you reflecting on what you did on what you learned and \nthen organizing this to share with other people And that will really deepen your understanding and \nmake you a powerhouse So yes sharing does improve your expertise but more than that when you \nshare you build trustTechniques for engaging audiences with your content\n 217\nWhen you build trust you grow your reputation and people will invite you to work on more challenging \nprojects and give you more responsibility This in turn increases your expertise and skills So actually \nsharing is the best way for you to increase your expertise\nThe last myth well talk about here is that sharing is only done in events or public spaces Thats not \ntrue Y ou can share with your friends your colleagues at work and your team All of those ways to \nshare are valid important and will build your reputation Y ou dont need to have a public worldwide \nreputation to make a difference in your career If people in your team people in your company see you \nas the expert in a certain area you will get more responsibilities and access to more interesting projects \nand will grow in your career and in your company  even if you dont share that information publicly \nBut doing this publicly will actually increase your reputation in other areas for other companies This  \ncan lead to you meeting amazing people and getting access to other experts This will be beneficial for \nyou for your company for your project and especially for your career So although you dont have  to \nshare publicly it will be really beneficial for you\nTechniques for engaging audiences with your content\nAs we close this chapter lets talk about engaging your audience We talk in other parts of the book \nabout techniques for effective storytelling Humans remember and engage with content through \nstories This is how you connect with other people and gain understanding There are a few key points \nto remember when you use these storytelling techniques One that is especially important is to focus \non your opening or your hook that you will use to engage your audience as you share your story \nEqually important is your closing which should retrace your opening points as a way of closing the \nstory you are sharing\nY ou will also want to incorporate visual aids when you are sharing your content Consider adding \nvisual aids to all of your content If you are sharing in person utilize props to convey your points or \nget into character Something like a hat glasses shoes or any other signature item can set the tone \nand be incorporated as an element of sharing your content For example Bruno will typically wear \nthe Brazilian flag as a cape when he is sharing his content Also consider your use of slides when \nyou are sharing content in a presentation The slides should help to communicate your content as an \naid or a prompt Y ou should not be reading your slides  this is commonly known to disengage an \naudience The bullets on slides should guide you as a speaker and the audience to follow your story \nbut they should not be competing with you for attention Y our audience will either focus on reading \nthe slides or listening to you Y ou want them to listen to you In general think about ways of engaging \nyour audience This could be asking questions or asking them to participate or share suggestions in \nresponse to your content Ask them to share feedback with you Effective sharing and communication \nis a twoway streetScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs

places But right \nnow Jim is the quantum computing man\nQ Can you tell us where your career started\nA In the early days I went to school for computer technology but then dropped out due to the \npressures of life wanting to get married and start a family and I thought I could make more money \nin the restaurant industry I put the dream of being a computer scientist on hold and went eight years \nin the restaurant industry but became increasingly unhappy This was in the 1970s a long time ago\nBut as I was in that industry then and I had a TRS80 level 1 so I decided to go ahead and create the \nfirst ever restaurant drivethrough ordering pointofsale system because I wanted to sell that and \nbuy a model 3\nI created an assembly language in Z80  dialogue 80 If you had a basic program that was no problem \nY ou d just load it and then you could save it to the cassette tape If you bought the game Space Invaders \na game that was written in machine language it wasnt a basic program If your tape messed up you \nwere out of luck Y ou had to buy the game again\nSo I created an application in a dialogue machine language to copy tapes from one to another to bring \nthe tape into memory and then I could save it to another tape In that era I was managing a restaurant \nand decided to use a pointofsale system The TRS80 had three components to it the keyboard the \nmonitor and the tape deck So I mounted things into the drivethrough Then people could take \nthe order with the funky TRS80 keyboard see the order see the lanes and see the maps of the cars \nSome of the routines were in assembly language so that it would be very quick when somebodys order \nwas fulfilled I didnt even own a TRS80 so I would hang out at Radio Shack and learn how to do it \nthats where I was when John Lennon died\nI had a lot of my life experiences back then while I was working at managing and building things \nfor the restaurant such as inventory systems I was also moonlighting for other companies to create \napplications such as building applications for a golf course\nThen at one point I decided that I d just quit my job go into this fulltime and start a business Then \nI lost my shirt Things were lean and I was married I really had a couple of lean years before I got \ninto more consulting  thats about when the IBM PCs came out I learned dBASE and some other \ntechnologies including a technology called Framework I built a consulting practice learning new \nskills along the way I was hired by EDS and worked there for 15 years mostly supporting engineering \ncomputing scientific computing and then factory floor automation In 2000 I started an educational \ntechnology business sold it in 2008 and struck out on my own again as an individual contributor \ncreating JavaFX applications for companies I also worked for Oracle and then Pivotal and now IBMInterview\n 219\nQ When I hear the story of how you started your career and how it evolved I realize youve had a lot \nof transitions in your career Often people are for whatever reason either forced to make a transition \nor want to make a transition based on having realized certain things Do you have any learnings from \nall those transitions that you had or tips and advice that you can draw from your career\nA There is no one size fits all but generally you should always get into a situation where you can be \npassionate about what youre doing because if you dont youll be unhappy If you can help it dont be \nunhappy Dont consciously go into a situation or role where you know youre going to be unhappy \nDont try to force yourself to fit into something youve talked yourself into saying  I can tolerate this \nfor a while   Its almost never in my experience a good thing Its better to really think it through and \nnot be unhappy for big periods of time find things that youre passionate about and do those things\nFor example there is a trap that Ive run into where I thought to advance my career I was going to \nhave to take a management track and through experience Ive found that Im not really happy being \na manager Ive found out over the last 20 years that Im much happier in an individual contributor \nrole If I knew back then what I know now I would have tried to stay in an individual contributor role \neven if the advancement wasnt so quick and the pay wasnt as great because I could be passionate \nand was more suited for that role rather than being unhappy in management Think it through what \nare you really passionate about\nQ Thats good advice follow your passions We talk about this in the book too having a plan a vision \nand a map keeping in mind your passions and staying true to what your interests are\nCan you give an example of your transitions Y ou worked at Oracle Y ou worked at Pivotal Now youre \nat IBM and youre a quantum computing developer advocate  how did that come about\nA About seven years ago at a JavaOne panel there were some prominent people There was James \nGosling there was the guy that invented CCPIP  there was Vint Cerf and there were some others \nThey were talking about the direction of computing In an offhand way Cerf said Y ou know Ive \nbeen looking at Shors algorithm thinking that quantum computing could offer some exponential \nincreases in the speed of some algorithms  I had never heard of Shor I hadnt really looked into \nquantum computing at all but based on the fact that Cerf said it I wiki d it followed the rabbit fell \ninto the rabbit hole and became passionate about it\nThat was when I was working at Oracle and Pivotal I started steering my career toward quantum \ncomputing and putting it into my talks At Pivotal I was educating my developer community not \nonly in Spring and Java but also in quantum computing That led to IBM reaching out to me and \nsaying We hear you are doing the work of an IBM developer evangelist or an advocate Why dont \nyou come do it for usScaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 220\nQ How do you get success in life\nA Its a textbook question\nFirst of all success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal I set goals and then progressively \nrealize those goals by breaking them down\nQ We can talk about balance  you mentioned that when you were more junior in your career journey \nyour marriage was important to you Y ou have a good story of balance Oftentimes you have your wife \nwith you when you travel and you make sure you include your wife Do you have any stories about \nbalancing your home life and work life in your career\nA For sure Im fortunate that I will have been married to Julie for 47 years this November and shes \nput up with a lot because my career is very important to me and translates to supporting the family \nThats very important to me of course but so is the content of what I do in my career I love it I \nprobably wont ever retire because its my hobby\nAs a parent you need to work to make sure that the family is supported But then if you add to that \nthe fact that you love what you do anyway its easy to get out of balance and you could justify that loss \nof balance sometimes Its my work and I have to do it  But in reality I dont think its ever necessary \nto do that Y ou can rationalize it but your process of rationalization is often a copout to either satisfy \nyour desire to do the fun thing that youre doing or to overemphasize your need to provide How \nmuch do you need to provide How much do you need in a 401k How much do you need to spend \ndoing what youre passionate about\nAs Ive gone through my career Ive found that I dont need as much as I thought Its like eating or \nany other thing that brings pleasure When youre talking about the joy that you get out of your career \nthe first bite is the best After a while its just a chore to eat but youre doing it because youre still \ngetting a little bit of a dopamine hit\nIts the same with working I dont need to sit at a computer for eight hours working on a problem \nWhy not try to do it efficiently prioritizing work and using whatever tools you need to Have you \nheard of Pomodoro Sometimes you work too much but Ive found that thats almost never necessary \nbecause through planning prioritization and being realistic about how much money you need and \nhow much you really need to satisfy your desire to code you can actually attain that\nThis is a successinlife thing One component of being successful in life is deciding what youre going \nto sacrifice what youre going to give for success Whatever it is that you say thats what it will cost \nyou So if you say Im going to work 40 hours a week  or Im going to devote this much time and \nthis much energy and this much cost to something  then it just seems like the way that its worked \nout is that thats what life requires of you Y ou gain those benefits that you have agreed to in life\nY ou could say Im going to spend 120 hours a week working and traveling  Somebody else could say \nYou know something Im going to give 35 hours a week of concentrated effort and Im going to give Interview\n 221\nmy family time and balance it   Either will be successful Either will give you monetary and pleasure \nrewards Its just what the contract says Why not agree with life itself and say This is the way it works  \nWhy not say OK Im going to give this much to this this much to this  Y ou then end up with a more \nbalanced life while still getting the things that you and your family need\nI wrote a very short book to help people going through exactly this process Y ou need to think about \nyour whole life What are your goals  personal professional and financial Most people get stumped \nbecause they only think about career Thats why people dont have a lifework balance because they \nonly think about work How can you have lifework balance if you only think about working\nQ Exactly\nDo you have a story of where you feel like you made an impact by participating in the community \nThat would be motivating to people who arent yet engaged in a community\nA This story ties into career progression as well as impact on the community\nI gave a presentation at JavaOne 2022 on QiskitBlocks Its a program that I wrote about three years \nago its a Minecraftlike program in which highschool students college students adults  whoever \n can learn quantum computing concepts I wrote it and put it out on GitHub and its been very \nsuccessful Its been downloaded starred and forked and its been very helpful for thousands of people \nin learning quantum computing\nOftentimes people ask me How can I get into X field Whats the best way  What Ive always told them \nis to first make sure that you like X If you like X youre naturally going to be coding some technology \nand youre naturally going to want to write things in whatever that technology is Y oure going to want \nto build things if thats your passion When you build things give them to the public Put them on \nGitHub Make them accessible to other people and then blog about it Teach people how to use the \nthing that you built because the best way to learn something about X is to teach it and build in it\nQiskitBlocks is a prime example of it I did that while I was working at IBM but lets say that I was \nworking somewhere else and I was trying to get into quantum computing Lets say I was working for \nanother company getting passionate about quantum computing and I built a similar thing only it \nwas a musical application It was a quantum toy piano and it helped me learn quantum computing \nIt helped me get exposure to the point that someone reached out to me and offered me a job in it\nMy advice then would be that if youre passionate about some technology dont feel discouraged \nthat youre new in it or youre new in the industry Y ou have way more power and influence than you \nthink you do If you create an application that people can use to have fun with and learn about it and \nyou put it out there for people then you learn they learn and you become perceived as an expert in \nit or at least someone that people can call to help them\nAs for the job market if youre on the outside the perception is I cant get in   But if youre in a \ncompany and youre looking for people to fill a position that requires an expert in something you Scaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 222\nfind that a lot of times you cant find those people So if you as a recruiter then connect with some \nopen source project that you see thats really cool that somebody has built arent you going to reach \nout Y oure going to at least check them out\nThe other answer I was going to give was to say that success is where preparation meets opportunity \nAn opportunity presents itself because someone needs what you can offer They see your project and \nthen all of a sudden youre working for that company\nQ Thats great Y ou mentioned the perception that people have of you The perception that people have \nof you is reputation Thats exactly the definition of reputation Reputation is what people think about \nyou and believe about you and if you dont show up  if you dont help others if you dont present if \nyoure not visible  then people dont know about you\nA Thats the whole thing with servant leadership Heather and Bruno youre our poster children for \nservant leadership Y ou both are and that is in my opinion what you want to be for career success\nQ So we have Bazlur and Mimar Bazlur was on the Java education initiative So is Mimar\nWhat did you think of the Java education initiative and the JCP  Mimar\nMimar  Firstly I want to say its a great honor to speak with you I am so excited\nQ Let me help you out a little bit here Mimar sent me all his stories written down\nHeather  I know Mimar Hes from Turkey I met him there in person He sent me all his stories He \nsays that he prepared the first Java video in Turkish in 2008 It was 150 hours across five DVDs \nMimar  Thanks\nHeather  Thanks for this training Many people in Turkey got to know loved and learned Java \nThanks He loves Java and he has produced content and hes very excited Its a great honor to speak \nwith you Mimar Thats awesome\nMimar  Thank you\nHeather  Ive been learning Java since 2001 I have been invited to 10 countries I have given more \nthan 100 seminars I have talked to universities and companies about Java I have written 5 books and \npublished more than 500 hours of video cards and Java technology Thanks Mimar Thats awesomeInterview\n 223\nMimar  This is my first book Java Server Pages  and this is Android and Java  my third book This is \nmy fourth book 40s Hibernate and Java  This is my fifth book Spring Framework \nI want to continue At the moment I create with Java microservices and the Java blockchain I will \nwrite about these subjects At the moment Im writing two new books for the Java community\nHeather  Thats good\nMimar you seem to have had a lot of success in Java in your career What is the message that you \nwant to give to other developers\nMimar  In my experience Ive come across many fellow developers whove faced similar challenges \nI initially started out as a frontend technologist navigating the complexities of various technologies \nthroughout my career journey These transitions were consistently tough and I truly understand the \nhurdles that new developers often encounter\nMy primary focus has been on teaching Java a language thats known to be quite intricate Despite \nits reputation for being challenging Ive been able to create effective guides that streamline the \nlearning process By employing methods such as simplifying explanations using visual aids and \nconducting interactive seminars Ive been able to demonstrate that Java can indeed be comprehensible \nand approachable\nAs of now there are roughly 20003000 developers in Turkey However I believe this number has \nthe potential to skyrocket especially if I continue my current efforts I consistently provide valuable \ninsights and share a plethora of new information playing my part in shaping the ongoing evolution \nof development practices and contributing to the future of this dynamic field\nHeather  Bazlur is a recent Java Champion  tell us a little bit about it How do you become a Java \nChampion What do you have to do\nBazlur  First of all it starts with passion Im a very passionate Java developer Ive been doing Java \nfor over a decade\nI did a couple of things First of all I started a Java JUG group back at home in Bangladesh and I \ncontinued to be a leader of the Java JUG group doing a lot of sessions Ive been doing the Java JUG \ngroup thing for a while Ive been doing a lot of inperson sessions and online sessions I also invite a \nlot of Java JUG group leaders and Java Champions to my Java JUG groups That way I build a network\nI have also done a lot of writing I write on various blogs  InfoQ and others  and I also have my own \nblogging platform Thats also contributed to me becoming a Java Champion\nApart from that I have also written a couple of books in my native language which is Bengali I have \nwritten four in total All of it contributed to me becoming a Java Champion\nIt means more recognition from your peers Y ou have to be outspoken so that when you meet people \nand other Java Champions they can see your work and your contribution Y ou can be an expert \nindividually Y ou can work for a company for a long time  thats definitely amazing It will give you a Scaling Trust through Public Engagement Speaking and Blogs 224\nsteady income as well But if you want to achieve other things  such as the honor that I have been given \n you have to be outspoken Y ou have to network with people do community work and write stuff\nI dont speak a lot but I have started to grow my speaking career recently I love to write Thats the \none thing that I keep doing and have been doing for a while It helps your inner life Y ou could be \nwriting on any interesting technology that you work with but when you articulate it in the written \nform thats where the challenge comes When you develop youll find a lot of things that you probably \ndidnt know so thats really important Y ou know you know things but when you have something to \nteach to others in some medium or other  whether speaking or writing  its always challenging It \nforces you to learn a lot of new things Thats what happens for me\nAlong the way doing all of those things I made a lot of friends I met all of you in fact Thats essentially \nhow I became a Java Champion\nHeather  All right Thats awesome Y ouve shared books youve presented and youve written a lot \nyou like to write For developers writing is such an important skill because thats what we do We \nwrite code If you write well  if youre able to write an article for example  youre going to be a \nbetter developer Y oure going to write code better Those two things are very much linked in the brain \nwriting code and writing articles\nY ouve done all this writing and become a Java Champion But my question to you Bazlur is this has \nany of that impacted your career Are you better off because of it Was it worthwhile Is there anything \nthat happened to you in your career that made you say Man this is awesome It really helped me  \nOr is all of this just a distraction\nBazlur  Its definitely not just a distraction I have received many opportunities because of all of this \nA lot of interesting opportunities have come to me because of all the things I do Y ou mentioned a \ncouple of things writing is definitely one thing that has led to opportunities\nFor example I worked in InfoQ on a renowned tech content platform If you write content they pay \nyou They reached out to me because of all the things I used to do So I can write and get paid Thats \nan amazing thing\nI also get to know about opportunities For example I found out about the current job that I have \nbecause I know someone who used to work with that company and we have been friends for a while \nHe told me that there was an opportunity there So you get to know about opportunities sometimes \nopportunities come to you because you do a lot of these things If you are visible to the community \npeople see you and people start to trust you When youre working you want to be someone who \npeople are happy to trust and give responsibility to  but they need to trust you first They cannot give \nyou any responsibility if they dont know you\nThats why I would say these things are really important Ive been a Java Champion for a few months \nand it has helped me in expanding my network People I used to follow and look up to I was not able \nto reach directly  now I can do that Hopefully that will help me in future to get more opportunities \nas this is definitely helping me to expand my networkSummary\n 225\nAll of the things that Ive been doing are awesome I dont think they are a distraction These are \nvery beneficial\nHeather  OK Thats awesome\nI just want to quickly mention Hussein saying Please give me the motivation to study  Hussain I \ncannot give you motivation For motivation you have to look around Look at your family Look at your \nlife Look at the things you want to do Y ou will have to build motivation by looking at your situation\nThere are two main ways Hussein to have motivation\nOne is looking forward to somewhere you want to get to a happy place where you want to be Look \nat those things that you want that you want to become that you want to have Look at the things that \nyou want to be in the future  thats one way to get motivation\nAnother way to get motivation is to think where do you want to run from What are the pains in your \nlife right now What are the things that are hurting you What are the things that are hurting your \nfamily What are the things that are bad for you right now Our brains love to run towards something \ngood but our brains want much more to run away from bad things Run towards good things run \naway from bad things thats a great way for you to build motivation\nAll right Bazlur thanks a lot for being here with us Thanks a lot for giving your time\nBazlur  Thank you\nSummary\nIn this chapter you gained

importance of finding the right platforms to initiate your sharing efforts \nBy identifying suitable channels to reach your target audience you can maximize the impact of your \nmessage and expand your reach\nIn the next chapter we will delve into the subject of becoming a technical leader by mastering the \nart of managing relationships across the organizational hierarchy including managing upwards \ndownwards and across departments13\nBe a Leader Manage Up Down \nand Across Y our Organization\nTo be a leader and a toplevel developer you need to understand leadership and be able to deal with \nyour team and your managers Having the skills to manage up  talking and negotiating with your \nboss other managers and executive directors to manage down  inspiring your team and peers and \nto manage across  reaching out to people inside and outside of your organization will allow you to \nlead and have a larger impact inside your team and company and also outside in your communities\nIn this chapter you will learn how to be a leader Even if you dont have a leadership role you will learn \nhow to lead by serving and helping listening and asking questions inspiring people to take action \nand using your leadership to build trust in the market\nIn this chapter we will cover the following\n How to be a leader even if you dont have a leadership role\n Lead by

Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 228\nOne criterion for technical professionals to be considered for advancement is leadership Y ou may that \nleadership does not relate to technical careers but you would be wrong Y ou are a leader Even if you \ndont have the official title of manager or team lead you are a leader Y ou are the leader of your own \ncareer journey In his bestselling leadership book The First 90 Days  Michael D Watkins talks about the \nimportance of your responsibility to manage yourself Part of this responsibility is your relationship \nwith your manager If you want to progress toward senior levels of your technical career you will \nneed to be perceived as a leader Senior developers may not have a team lead designation but they \nare often expected to be a leader in their roles and to demonstrate leadership abilities One common \nquestion then is how do you demonstrate leadership without anyone to lead Y ou need to expand \nyour understanding of leadership As Grace Hopper said Y ou manage things you lead people  The \nability to lead others starts with the ability to manage yourself One of the most important tips for \nthis is plan to plan  devoting time to planning your day your week your month and your year \nand also focusing on the important work\nThis is somewhat similar to the Big Rocks  approach we talked about earlier in this book It is easy to \nget caught up in meetings and with emails Slack and social media All of those things are necessary \nbut you must dedicate time to do the important work What is the important work  you may ask The \nimportant work is the work that will help you to achieve your goals and how you ensure that if you \nachieve your goals you will be promoted This is where your relationship with your manager comes into \nplay Many developers and employees in general take the approach that they do what their manager \ntells them and will even avoid meetings with their manager because they dont want to be given \nnew tasks or hear complaints about their work This is where you can establish yourself as a leader \nby taking the attitude of a leader and being responsible for that relationship taking the initiative to \nschedule meetings determining your goals and priorities and establishing the criteria for success and \npromotion This attitude will showcase your leadership even though you do not yet have a leadership \nrole By establishing your goals and criteria for success together you will gain an understanding of \nthe priorities of your organization your group and your executive management and find out how \nyou and your contributions fit into the overall success of the organization\nWhen Heather was working early in her career she made the mistake of thinking that if she kept her \nhead down and worked hard she would be rewarded She did not understand the importance of being \nperceived as a leader and doing the work that was perceived by her management to be important \nOnce she understood how to demonstrate her leadership to her management there were subtle shifts \nin her career toward advancement\nWhile you do need to work hard you should not work long hours just for the sake of putting in the \ntime  A community member shared a story with us of a former colleague who was a hard worker \nas was he They would often be the only ones in the office until the late hours During one of those \nlate nights the colleague confided that they would often accidentally leave papers in the printer so \nthat their manager would see how late they work thinking this would make a good impression The \ncommunity member shared that he really was not impressed with that approach\nInstead look for ways to amplify your results and the work of yourself and your team members While \nyou should do your best when you are working on the correct things and taking responsibility for your Being a leader even if you dont have a leadership role  take a leadership attitude\n 229\nmanager you will be recognized for your contribution Artificial theatrics such as the technique used \nin this example are transparent and will be recognized as such Look for authentic ways to promote \nyour work such as achieving your performance goals and success metrics\nIf you want to advance in your career you need to be the master of yourself There are some core \ncomponents here in addition to the leadership skills we mentioned They are humility persistence \nand a positive mental attitude Heather learned these three skills early in her life from her grandfather \nwho served in the United States Marines and went on to be a successful businessman public speaker \nand philanthropist\nHeres an excerpt from his obituary As the first to attend college in his family he graduated from USC \nin June 1941 and traded his civilian clothes for a Marine Corps uniform and a commission as 2nd \nLieutenant Earning his wings he flew missions over the Islands before and during the battle For this \nhe was awarded the Bronze Star with a combat V   He retired from the Corps as a Lt Colonel\nHeather learned many of these details about his service only after his death in 2014 He was humble \nand only spoke of the future and what he planned to achieve He spoke of the things he wanted to \ndo Anytime someone asked him about working on a project he would say That sounds wonderful \nwhen can we get together to talk more about it These are lessons we can internalize and carry into \nour work in our technical careers\nHe also shared a quote about the value of persistence by Calvin Coolidge former President of the \nUnited States and lived by those words from his early career days working at the Los Angeles Times \nPersistence  press on\nNothing in the world can take the place of persistence\nTalent will not\nNothing is more common than unsuccessful men or women with talent\nGenius will not\nUnrewarded genius is almost a proverb\nEducation alone will not\nThe world is full of educated derelicts\nPersistence and determination are omnipotent\nHe instilled in her the power of a positive mental attitude and believing in yourself One of the life \nlessons he used to teach this was the power of a first impression  always have a positive attitude when \nmeeting people for the first time since you never get a second chance to make a good first impression \nThat lesson seems so obvious but the power of a positive attitude was ingrained into Heather from \na young age and she is known in the developer community for her positive outlook on life and the Be a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 230\npeople in her life One of the quotes she often draws on for hiring or advising others on hiring is by \nAmerican businessman Herb Kelleher Y ou dont hire for skills you hire for attitude Y ou can always \nteach skills \nThis is so true As we talked about in a previous chapter there is always something to learn but if \nyou embrace learning and become a lifelong learner you can always learn new skills It is much more \ndifficult to change your attitudes and beliefs To become a master and be the creator of your destiny \ntake this approach in your career and with your management It will serve you and your team well\nLeading by serving and helping  act as a leader in the \nteam\nAs we talked about in previous chapters building trust is essential to your career advancement This is \ntrue but once you build trust you will need to further build upon that trust to take your career to the \nnext level Y ou will need social capital or an emotional bank account with the people on your team\nSimon Sinek tells a story about the United States Navy SEALs  they are one of the highest performing \norganizations in the world A former Navy SEAL was asked who made it through their selection \nprocess called BUDS He said  I cant tell you who makes it but I can tell you the kind of people who \ndont make it The star college athletes and the tough guys with ripped muscles dont make it through the \npreening leaders who delegate everything dont make it through Some of the guys are skinny scrawny \nand shivering out of fear When they are emotionally and physically exhausted somehow they are able \nto dig down deep inside themselves to find the energy to help the person next to them  Service and the \nwillingness to help make the highest performing teams in the world  not their strength and not their \nintelligence Its their willingness to be there for each other\nTo be a leader in your team whether you have a designated team lead or manager title or not you \nneed to serve and be willing to help your team members There are many ways to lead your team Y ou \ncan offer to mentor new team members and teach them about the workflow or offer to pair program \nwith them or provide peer coaching There are skills you can master that will establish you as a leader \nin your team such as running meetings having crucial conversations giving and receiving feedback \nand attracting key talent\nLets start with running meetings As chairperson of the JCP program Heather has become an expert \nat running meetings successfully Being able to lead meetings is a skill that will establish your authority \nand leadership in a team Learn from some of her tips\n Decide on the best way to hold the meeting whether this is virtual in person or hybrid Usually \na combination will work best\n Spend at least twice as long planning the meeting as you expect it to last Prior preparation is \nkey to a successful meeting Y ou should prep all topic speakers and leaders with not only the \nagenda and details but also the expectations of the content how you think the content will be \nreceived and a review of the content in advance of the meetingAttracting top talent to your team\n 231\n Stick to an agenda with a timeline While it is tempting to let certain topics go on for longer than \nthe allotted time it is important to set the expectation that the meeting agenda and everything \non the agenda will be covered If you need more time to discuss a particular topic suggest \nanother future time to discuss the topic in more detail Y ou can also guide the conversation \nback to the agenda topic as necessary to keep the conversation on track\n Ensure that you are hearing a balanced view of the participants Y ou want to solicit the opinions \nof a majority and have a diversity of thought in meetings\n Plan breaks in the meeting every 70100 minutes Ensure that the breaks are long enough to \nallow for some informal discussion or quick phone callsemails in between topics\n Arrange the meeting room and schedule the timing to suit the majority of your participants \nIf you are meeting in person ensure the position of the seating is appropriate and there is \nseating for all If the meeting is remote or partially remote ensure the sound and audiovisual \nequipment is adequate for all participants Scheduling can sometimes be difficult in distributed \nand global teams Make an effort to vary the times between early morning and later in the day \nfor the needs of all attendees\n Invite only the required attendees If there are too many unnecessary attendees or bystanders\nobservers in the meeting it will decrease the impact and participation level overall\n Prepare opening and closing remarks When running a meeting you should have customary \nintroductory and closing remarks or action items planned in advance to ensure efficiency and \nthat nothing falls through the cracks or is not followed up on after the meeting\n Ensure all attendees are heard If one person is sharing all comments and feedback suggest that \nyou appreciate their perspective but you would like to hear from other people before coming back \nto hear more about their perspective If you think someone may have an interesting perspective \nbut is not speaking up suggest that they share their thoughts on the topic or encourage their \nparticipation A wellrun meeting will include varying viewpoints and feedback\n Take meeting notesa summary and distribute them to attendees\nNow that we have discussed how to be a leader of your team or within your team lets focus on \nattracting new talent to your team\nAttracting top talent to your team\nOne thing that is tremendously valued and shows leadership in a team is the ability to conduct \ninterviews and review the resumes of candidates\nResumes should not be too limiting in scope but should be specific and focus on projects that were \ncompleted or collaborated on not just jobs certifications and trainingdegrees Ask candidates to \nreference stories and examples from their experiences summarizing key points facts and solutions \nIf you are applying for a job you should also have stories and examples for interviews In an interview Be a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 232\nask candidates to demonstrate criticalthinking or problemsolving skills One of the best ways to \nevaluate problemsolving is to check whether candidates can do the following\n Break down the problem\n Realize its been done before in all likelihood so do their research\n Recognize that issuesroadblocks will be normal\n Research services and tools\n Test solutions and debug\nThe goal is to attract and hire the best talent so that you can make the team successful Once you \nhave played a critical role in the hiring process look for ways to onboard and peer mentor team \nmembers Increasingly peertopeer mentoring and pair programming are being implemented in \ncorporate environments Gone are the proverbial days of coders sitting alone and delivering code \nwithout speaking to anyone\nLet us not forget about retaining top talent Even in a tough economic period it is a valuable attribute \nto be able to retain talented team members It is disruptive not only to you and your productivity but \nalso to your team management and company overall to have a high level of attrition or turnover of \nteam members Do what you can to welcome and provide support to new team members Help them \nto assimilate and onboard into their new role This will be appreciated and noticed by your supervisors \nand team leaders That leads us to our next area of focus Lets talk a bit about feedback\nLeading by learning how to solicit and receive feedback\nLeaders know they should give feedback but it is often avoided because it makes them feel uncomfortable \nIt brings up anxiety fear or criticism in many people Think of feedback as sharing observations on \nwork performance and behaviors It can be positive or negative feedback but if you view it as an \nopportunity to reward and praise good work or suggest improvements in a constructive way for the \nfuture it can be an overall rewarding experience\nA key to soliciting and receiving feedback is learning how to listen and ask questions\nWe talked about listening earlier in the book when we discussed public speaking Listening is also \nkey to leadership and feedback And again as we have said before in this book you are responsible \nfor your relationship with your management and specifically with your manager Y ou can lead \nthis relationship with your management by asking questions and listening to the answers This will \nprovide you with so many insights One of the best questions to ask is how to communicate Which \nmethod is best for them and at what frequency and at what level of detail Communication as we \nhave stressed throughout this book is a vital skill to advance your career and even more so with your \nmanagement Y ou want to communicate in the style they want so adapt to their preferences and ask \nwhether your communications are meeting their needs am I doing this right Y ou also want to ask \nhow you are contributing to your organization or your groups success Time and again when asked Leading by learning how to solicit and receive feedback\n 233\nabout opportunities for advancement and promotion this is a required element to advance  how you \ncontribute to the overall success How does your contribution justify a promotion or raise\nY ou should be asking for and giving feedback on a regular basis That means that it is a process that \ncontinues throughout your employment and career journey  not just at the times you are requesting \na promotion or raise but as part of an ongoing dialogue with your manager Another thing you should \nbe asking about is what you should be focusing on this year or this quarter Y ou want to ensure that \nyou are aligned with the priorities of your management chain and that you are working on the items \nthat are of critical importance to your organization One thing that you can be sure will make you one \nof the favored team members is to think about how you can make your managers life easier\nEven better ask them how can I help to reduce your workload Not only will this help to direct and \nguide the projects you work on but it will also be a signal that you care about helping your management \nwith the workload they carry Y ou also can check in for feedback on your performance periodically \nDo not wait for the requisite performance evaluation period Have an ongoing conversation where \nyou are asking for feedback\nManagers are often reluctant to provide feedback because they are not sure of how well it will be \nreceived If you are willing to ask for specific feedback it will create the space and the opportunity \nfor your management to provide it Y ou can then incorporate the feedback into your performance \non an ongoing basis and by doing so you increase your opportunities to be rewarded for your \nperformance and strengthen the relationship with your management Ask how you are doing in any \ngiven circumstance and ask whether there is anything that you may have missed or that you could \nhave done better Often it is automatic to answer the question How am I doing with Great  \nY oure doing fine  or Keep up the good work  This is not necessarily helpful or specific On the \nother hand when you ask Is there anything that I can do to improve or Did I miss anything  \nthere is more actionable information in the answer that you will receive that will help you to adjust \nyour performance and work habits These are all fundamental questions that can help you in your \ncareer Asking them is essential but listening and incorporating the answers into your daily work will \nbe required in order to achieve the benefits\nSometimes we ask questions but we do not really want to hear the answers We like to think that we \nknow the answers or that we are doing amazing work and that may very well be true However you \nneed to be vigilant to actively listen to the information that is provided in the answers Active listening \nis an important communication skill that helps you to understand problems better and also helps you \nto effectively collaborate with your peers and managers Active listening will not only make your \nconversations more successful but it will also help other people feel more valued and heard When \nyou are actively listening you are engaging with the speaker and you indicate your understanding by \nusing eye contact being present in the moment using gestures such as nodding asking openended \nquestions to receive more feedback summarizing what the other person has said and asking for \nagreement have you understood correctly When you practice active listening you are listening \nfor understanding not waiting for your moment to respond or provide a rebuttal and not judging \nyou are coming from a place of mutual understanding to really listen hear and apply what the other \nperson is saying When you ask the right questions that is only the first part To reap the benefits of Be a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 234\nasking questions you need to be willing to listen and hear the answers for understanding If you can \nask the right questions and listen to the answers you are setting yourself apart for advancement and \nrecognition of your communication skills and organizational abilities in your career Y ou can also \nextend these skills to peer feedback and coaching\nIt may feel awkward at first to give feedback regularly but it is an integral part of being a leader \nFeedback increases selfawareness and enables continuous improvement A major study showed that \nemployees who receive feedback have a lower turnover and increased productivity and profitability \ncompared with employees who receive no feedback\nY ou can give feedback in all directions in the organization Y ou can think of it as a continuous feedback \nloop to improve your team as individuals and as a whole to increase your overall performance \nRemember that feedback is not a oneway street Y ou can give feedback to people who are less senior \nin different groups peertopeer on your team and also to your management Think of feedback as \npart of a partnership with your employees  a mutual commitment to helping each other improve \nIts an investment in the organizations longterm success\nLearning how to have difficult conversations\nWhen you are interviewing team members onboarding team members giving and receiving feedback \nand having peertopeer coaching sessions you will need another skill in your leadership repertoire\nY ou will need to learn how to have difficult conversations In the book Crucial Conversations  by Kerry \nPatterson Joseph Grenny Ron McMillan and Al Switzler they lay out a framework for having these \nconversations and being successful with them They call it How To Spot The Conversations That Are \nKeeping You From What You Want \n Get unstuck  This is the law of crucial conversations If you find yourself stuck there is probably \na conversation that you are either not having or you are having it and it is not going well The \nfirst step is to identify where you are stuck and the second step is to unbundle it with the content  \nthe problem the pattern  a pattern of behavior over time and the relationship  define how \nthe problem affects your relationship\n Start with the heart  Change starts with the heart and this begins when you focus on trying \nto improve yourself Here you can focus on asking yourself some questions about what you \nreally wantfor yourself the relationship and the organization\n Master my stories  Here the steps are separate facts from the story Watch for clever stories \nvictim villain helpless that propel or justify behaviors and then tell the rest of the story in \nterms of what you should do to bring the story to a successful outcome\n State my path  This is how to speak persuasively to express your views in a way that is candid \nand respectful to others Share your facts tell your story and ask for other perspectives Do \nthis with confidence and curiosityOptimizing your presence  hybrid environments and global teams\n 235\n Make it safe  The book makes the case that people do not become defensive about the content \nof what you say but about why you say it or why they think you are saying it When people are \nat cross purposes they can become offended There are two skills highlighted here for crucial \nconversations apologize when appropriate to address misunderstandings between what others \nthink and your real motivations\nUsing the tools in this book you will be able to have these highstakes conversations with opposing \nopinions and strong emotions This ability will certainly lead to you being perceived as a valuable \nteam member and a soughtafter leader within your organization Being a person who can collaborate \nand bring varying opinions together for the benefit of the team and organization means that you are \na person who can be trusted and it will enable you to build social capital with your team members\nOptimizing your presence  hybrid environments and \nglobal teams\nY our presence will also impact how your leadership ability is perceived Today a lot of teams are remote \nhybrid distributed or decentralized in some way When teams are set up this way and accepted as \nthe norm we can forget about the value of face time or seeing each others faces In the Face time \nstill matters  article from the Harvard Business Review  they discuss the current dynamic of hybrid and \nglobal teams They offer the following advice and strategies for being intentional and even creative \nwith deciding when and how to show your face\n If you have the opportunity to go to an office to meet with colleagues make those days about \ncommunication whether it is individual meetings group meetings or just informal conversations \nY ou will be able to make a greater leadership impact this way Share the dates when you will be \nin the office to make yourself accessible to team members who may also be able to be present \nin the office on that day\n Use video as a backup and embrace it by keeping your camera on  you can show your face \nvirtually This is especially important during projects that are difficult or complicated This will \nalso help you to demand focus and attention from your team members\n Dont forget your nonverbal communication either Y ou can align your nonverbal cues with \nyour messages and the leadership you are projecting in all of your meetings whether they \nare virtual or in person Keeping your body language open will help with this  your posture \nshould be open upward and leaning toward the other parties or your camera Think about \nthe expression you have on your face when you are speaking or listening  this is also part of \ncommunicating with your colleagues\nIt may seem insignificant to consider how you are perceived in regard to your physical presence \nbut this is an important element to consider as you are positioning yourself as a technical leader \ncreating an impact in your team and across your organization and one that executive management \nwill surely noticeBe a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 236\nHow to inspire people to take action\nAs you start to practice demonstrating leadership in your role you will also need to learn how to \ndevelop specific leadership competencies We have discussed many leadership competencies already \nearlier in this book As you develop your skills and practice using them you will find that some skills \ncome more naturally to you than others  Some of the most useful skills to develop to demonstrate \ntechnical leadership are decisionmaking conflict resolution and strategic or critical thinking These \nare skills you develop by practicing them in your team Make a conscious effort to develop these skills \nand to evaluate your strengths\nIn the classic bestselling book The Leadership Challenge  written by James M Kouzes and Barry Z \nPosner they describe the five practices of exemplary leadership This is a book that Heather has drawn \non in her career and it has been described as the foundation and roadmap of leadership skills The \nprinciples of leadership they cite in the book are the following\n Model the way  set the example you would like to see followed\n Inspire a shared vision  communicate a vision that compels action\n Challenge the process  question the standard operating procedure of how things have always \nbeen done\n Enable others to act  remove the roadblocks that prevent progress toward the shared vision\n Encourage the heart  celebrate and encourage the successes of team members along the way\nAll of these principles work together to inspire action by other people Y ou will find that there are \npractices that align more closely with your skillset and style Develop this style but also learn to \nincorporate other practices or styles as you grow in your career and in your leadership abilities\nWhen combined these principles incite action We believe that at the heart of leadership and inspiration \nis storytelling This is the most underrated skill for developers for leaders and for all people It is the \nworlds oldest skill and the way we pass on knowledge skills and experiences  sharing stories How \ndo you learn these skills Y ou learn these skills through practice and guidance We will share with \nyou our guidelines for sharing a story\n Use an example from your life that you are proud of that relates to the topic\n Convey your point in a concise way early in the story and explain why it matters\n Explain your specific role in the story\n Convey the impact\n Express gratitude and be authentic\nWhen you combine these elements you have the ingredients for stories that will not only teach but \nalso inspire action We suggest that you have some stories in your portfolio  either on your phone \ntablet or computer perhaps even in a notebook so that you are ready to share them in moments when Using your leadership to build trust in the market  build visibility for you and your cause\n 237\nthey are needed In the moments when a leader is needed sharing a story can help the community \naround you and also put you in a leadership position What are some stories that every developer \nshould consider preparing We have listed a few prompts for your consideration\n A project that had unclear responsibilities and how you resolved this\n A project where you had to lead without direct authority\n A project where you had to rely on yourself to complete a task or project that should have been \na group project or task\n A project you worked on with unclear or incomplete information\n A project or a time that changed your outlook or thinking\n A time you had to make a bold decision and the outcome\n A time you had to speak up in a difficult or uncomfortable situation\n A project where you fell short of your own expectations or standards\n A project where you came up with a simple solution to a complex problem\n A project where you used large amounts of data to develop a solution\n A project where you had to correct a problem or mistake\nThese are examples of stories that you can use to inspire people to take action and highlight your \nsuccesses These are useful for job interviews but also for personal leadership and branding No matter \nwhat your role is in the organization there is always an opportunity to step up and demonstrate your \nability to motivate people to act Find the types of projects that you are passionate about and share \nthat passion to inspire the people around you This is the type of person who is continually viewed \nas a leader of high potential\nUsing your leadership to build trust in the market  build \nvisibility for you and your cause\nThe best senior developers have a basic technical foundation  not necessarily the best technical skills \nbut they have excellent problemsolving and criticalthinking skills They possess a deep understanding \nof projects that they work on they have developed leadership and engineering management skills \nand they are organized and efficient communicators\nTechnical leaders are mature They accept the reality of the market Rather than thinking their \nsolutions are always best they realize that there are dozens if not hundreds of ways to do the same \nthing They know that code will never run on the first try and testing unit testing automated testing \nand debugging skills are highly valuable  not something to be handed off to another department \nor sent to another team for Quality Assurance  QA They realize that 7580 of software projects \nare brownfield maintenance projects  nearly everyone in a technical role cites greenfield projects as Be a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 238\npreferred but expecting to always work on greenfield projects is simply not realistic and is the sign \nof an immature software developer Working on longterm projects with or without technical debt \nrequires skill to ensure the maintainability of the code and strategic thinking to design and write code \nthat will integrate with the existing code and be current with standards at the present time It also \nrequires strong debugging skills to test the code when new features are added and investigate and solve \nissues that are introduced and bugs in the code base Technical leaders value and nurture teamwork \n mentoring new members and collaborating via peer programming or other tools to branch merge \nand resolve conflicts with other team members Software development team members do not work \nin isolation It is a highly choreographed yet often imperfect symphony of players This is where your \nsoft skills and honed attributes in collaboration and communication allow you to shine\nThere are specific challenges that software developers may face in managing up down and across their \norganization in a technical context and challenges that community managers may face in building \nand maintaining relationships with software developers It would be helpful to explore these specific \nchallenges and provide guidance on how to navigate them effectively\nInterviews\nVictor Grazi\nQ Victor Grazi thanks for meeting with me Im eager to hear your career story because I know \nyouve had so much success in your career Lets start with you sharing a little bit about how you got \nstarted in your technical career and some of the things that you were doing when you first entered\nA Ive always been in love with technology\nMany years ago we had a family factory a linen business We were delivering things per order We d \nget a cluster of orders and somebody would go and pick out an order and if anything needed to be \nmanufactured they d go upstairs and they d manufacture a few dozen of that order I looked at this \nsystem and said Well what are we doing here Were manufacturing little bits of this and little bits \nof that They have these computers now that mean you can consolidate these things\nSo we bought a computer I learned Business Basic and I programmed a program that took all \nour orders and told us exactly what to manufacture at once It actually told you how to allocate the \norders so we created slots on the warehouse floor and we were able to allocate our manufacturing \nproduction accordingly\nThat was my start As for getting into the real world of computing  Java and everything  its a funny \nstory Around 1995 my brother and I heard about some new technology called the internet and how \nyou could do some really wild stuff using something called Java and applets it was just starting around \nthat time Using some of the programming experience I had from Business Basic and some experience \nI had with mainframes I got to work learning HTML Java and SQL Server I had to be my own DBAInterviews\n 239\nWe created a dotcom company called Supermarkets to Go It was something of a shopping franchise \nwhere we would brand websites for supermarkets telling them Everybody will be looking for you \nonline  That was our tagline\nThat worked really well until around 1999 what with the dotcom bubble bursting So I had to look \nfor a real job I got into the financial industry around then and Ive been there ever since and really \nlove it I think the financial industry is great Im an executive director now in a major financial firm\nLuck is a big part of it hard work is a big part of it and so is contributing to the community Right \nnow with GitHub and so many available resources such as Stack Overflow its very important and \nvery easy to get involved In the olden days you just didnt have these opportunities but now there \nare so many If youre a Java developer you can go and look at the Java Community Process you can \nlook at all the JSRs and you can make a difference by contributing to these things Its important its \ngreat resume experience\nAbout 15 years ago I was doing some investigation into concurrency Concurrency was really hard \nto understand and I think its still hard I do dozens of interviews with expert Java developers and \nso many of them just dont get concurrency I started poking around and I think thats something \nthats really important for people to do if they dont understand something Download it start poking \naround and get into the intricacies of it\nAs I was looking into concurrency and I started building little programs to show me what would \nhappen if this thread did that and this thread did that or if they tried to do this at the same time Then \nI said It would be very easy to animate these things  So I started creating animations and before \nyou know it I had animations for all of the major concurrency components So I said Let me open \nsource this thing  and we put it online Now we get thousands of downloads and Ive been all over \nthe world presenting this thing I call it Java Concurrent Animated\nThats just an example of something that you have to do  get good at something and find problems \nthat are hard Dont duck away from the hard problems but immerse yourself in them Try to really \nunderstand them Be the goto guy or girl for that particular thing and thats how you get on the \nmap I think thats the secret\nAnother really big secret is to be nice Keep a smile on your face This is our lives  lets enjoy it Help \npeople enjoy it and give back to the community I think were in a super industry Were poised to soar \ninto the next generation with things such as machine learning and AI These provide opportunities \nfor technologies far beyond any other industry so this is something that people should be capitalizing \non in this industry\nQ Thats a common thread that I hear in my work and when talking with developers who have progressed \nin their careers It typically does come down to the community having some interest Y ou have that \nstory of how you first got started in the community and that is almost like a lightbulb moment where \nyou realized that participating starts by understanding that theres a problem you want to learn more \nabout Y ou take it further make progress and get involved in the communityBe a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 240\nBut in terms of working inside a corporation I think you have a lot of insights to offer as well Maybe \nyou could share a story about influencing across an organization Tell us about building relationships \nand how you can use those influencing opportunities to advance your career\nA Its a hard question Getting into the company is always the hard part Once youre in theres trying \nto find those hardtosolve problems Managing relationships is really difficult and a lot of times were \nthrown in with difficult people Just learning how to navigate that is really important\nBut again keep that smile on your face when working with people and try to provide value in whatever \nyoure doing Dont be shy or embarrassed to move up the ladder Reach out Without stepping on toes \nreach out into other areas try to solve problems that are firmwide In an enterprise there usually are \nproblems Sometimes theyre difficult to solve but if you can be the person that solves them youre \ngoing to be well on your way to a successful career\nAlso reaching out publicly is very important I have a public profile My speaking engagements and \nthe fact that Im becoming well known in the community help me when Im looking for a new job or \nIm trying to navigate internally within my enterprise People look up to me because they know that \nI have those skills So creating a public profile is really important in helping you even internally in \nyour own career\nQ As for stating intentions sometimes people are reluctant to do that because they feel a little bit of \nimposter syndrome or assume its known that they want to advance to a certain level\nA Dont be shy  definitely dont be shy\nQ So do you have any suggestions or tips for how to put yourself out there especially if youre trying \nto be humble as is often the case with people that I meet\nA A big problem in our industry is that people tend to be a little bit geeky or shy sometimes we tend \nnot to be outgoing But sometimes you can look in the mud and find some diamonds and thats \nsomething that Im finding Often some of the shyest people are really the ones with the most talent \nbut a lot of these people will get laid off or just wont survive because of their shyness\nIts very important to reach out and try to overcome that humility that you were describing Y ou want \nto be humble and nice but you also want people to know who you are and its important to extend \nyourself a little bit to get there\nQ Y ou obviously are an author and a speaker Any suggestions for how to get started doing those \nthings Y ou shared a little bit about the project and how you started it but there may be some things \nthat seem obvious to you that you did to become an author and start writing about the work that you \ndid develop a talk and submit it to a conference to be a speakerInterviews\n 241\nA A lot of it is around understanding technologies Nowadays that is another thing thats really easy \nY ou can go to Udemy LinkedIn Learning or Pluralsight and become really good at any technology \nY ou get good at it Y ou can master it But even before you master it you can take what youve learned \nand start creating little training pieces and presentations\nIm not saying to plagiarize anything but you can go on to Udemy and learn how to do something and \nthen present what youve learned Try to immerse yourself in it Learn a little bit more about it Try to \nlearn how to answer the questions that you have as a learner Try to figure out what those answers are\nBy immersing yourself in that technology you can become more of an expert and then you can put \nthat into a presentation and thats what you submit There are lists of conferences online Java Python \nAI machine learning ChatGPT Learn something Become good at it Learn how to figure out the \nanswers Prepare a talk and submit it Y ou could submit it in the Java world theres also Oracle of \ncourse I dont know if were still going to have JavaOne this year but hopefully we will\nThere are so many different forums that are looking for good content Just prepare the content Prepare \na good summary and submit it in the calls for white papers Eventually youll get picked Nowadays \nthere are a lot of virtual conferences A lot of these conferences will pay for you to go Ive even had \nconferences pay for my wife to go They generally tend to pay for your airfare and your hotel so its \nreally good Just prepare content and submit it Y ou wont get hits from everybody but you will get \nsome hits\nQ I think it is a numbers game to some extent Y ou have to have a lot of nos to get to the yeses Its \nnot necessarily personal\nA The sale begins when the customer says no\nQ  Y ou mentioned ChatGPT How do you think that will play a role with developers I just got back \nfrom meeting with a bunch of students in Singapore and that was one of the most common questions \nthat I got A lot of junior professionals are looking at AI and machine learning ChatGPT in particular \nand wondering Is that going to make my job obsolete\nA Obsolete I dont know\nThere are two sides to ChatGPT One of them is using it to solve your problems I recently had \nsomebody in my firm who is not a developer at all and has no coding experience come to me and \nsay Can you give me an example of an interview question that you would ask a candidate I gave \nhim a basic question and I gave him an intermediate one and within a minute he came back with an \nanswer I said  Are you studying this How did you do that He replied No I just asked ChatGPT  \nI didnt know what it was at the time but he came up with the perfect solution\nSo on one side we as developers can use ChatGPT to help us figure out how to code stuff Im a Java \ndeveloper by profession but Ive been getting heavily involved in Python as well and I always have Be a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 242\nquestions what is this really arcane construct doing in Python I can go on ChatGPT paste it in there \nand say What does this mean ChatGPT Itll reply Here are some examples and this is what it \nmeans  Its really useful to us as technologists for helping us solve these problems\nAnother side is figuring out how to index our internal data and use it to create chatbots and things \nlike that internally in our own programs I have less experience with that and Im interested to learn \nmore about it\nQ Its interesting I was curious because I do get this question a lot from younger students getting \nready to graduate\nA Its such a great technology The other day I started to have ringing in my ears Normally I would \ncall up the doctor and say What should I do about this ringing in my ears I went on ChatGPT \nand it said Oh you have tinnitus Its very common and this is what could be causing it and this is \nwhat you need to do  It became my doctor\nQ Thats funny I talked to Frank Greco quite a bit about it when I saw him in Atlanta earlier this \nmonth He brought up some interesting things  cautionary tales He talked about coding it and then \nof course the legal implications of rights to the code if you were to use it\nA Well I have to tell you something Remember that story that I told you about the guy who wasnt \na developer and he asked me for a code challenge ChatGPT coded the solution perfectly but it was \nactually a trick question  there would have been a much simpler more elegant solution which it \ndidnt get\nQ That was what Frank Greco said He said half the time itll work and half the time it wont It \nprobably wont be as elegant as it could be  there are still skills needed that only people could supply\nDo you have any tips on interviewing Especially if youre interviewing a larger company and theres \ngoing to be a series of interviews that is something that causes a lot of angst  how do we pass \nthose interviews\nA Ive been doing tons of interviewing lately One thing is that sometimes just having a good \npersonality gets you much further than answering a question about an algorithm Be upbeat smile \nand crack a joke\nOf course you have to have the fundamental talent that theyre screening for And of course never put \nthings on your resume that you dont have Sometimes people put on their resume that they know how \nto use AngularJS and then I ask them how they would do something in Angular and they dont know\nSo dont put it on there just because you have used it once in your life or you took a single training \nsession on it Dont put it on your resume unless you can answer interview questions on itInterviews\n 243\nPrepare for your interview We have CodeWarrior and all these sites now where you can go and take \ntests and get better But most of all just use your charm\nQ Critical thinking is one thing that Ive found that a lot of employers ask about  the candidates \nability to think about a problem\nA 100 percent Its not always backcalculating the algorithm and figuring out the right solution Its \nabout being able to answer Were having this problem internally We need to optimize such and \nsuch How would you go about doing that Sometimes we can spend months thinking about that \nkind of thing so if a candidate can think about it in 30 seconds and come up with two or three good \nsolutions or at least start to propose a highlevel solution I d be impressed\nQ Just showing that you have the ability to think about a problem is important\nI guess that interviewing just like a call for papers comes down to a numbers game Y oure not going \nto be accepted at every call for papers youre not going to be accepted at every interview But the \nmore you do it the better you get\nA Y es\nTheres one thing thats really important and it was a horror story that happened to a friend of mine \nHe was looking for a job and he was having a hard time There was not a lot of hiring going on He \nfinally got an offer and then all of a sudden they withdrew the offer The reason was that two recruiters \nhad submitted him to the same company So before you allow anybody to submit your resume make \nsure that they clear it with you Make sure that youre not duplicating\nQ Y es because that would be a conflict for the company  thats definitely a good tip\nMore advice from Victor on job opportunities and interviews\nJobs in the technology industry tend to wax and wane but at the rate the world is developing new \ntechnology I would put all my money on that horse\nThat said we must consider that postpandemic with inflation at an alltime high and the United \nStates Federal Reserve endlessly raising rates we are seeing a downturn in business and hordes of \nlayoffs in every sector\nThis year alone Amazon laid off 18000 Meta 15000 Alphabet 12000 Microsoft 10000 and so on \nThese are skilled people all competing for your job\nSo how do you compete and how do you surviveBe a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 244\nI will give you some tips from my perspective\n First use a professional to craft your resume  robots screen your resume before a human \never sees it so you want to make sure it checks all the boxes Y ou can also search online for \nresumebuilding techniques\n If you are still in school do your very best to get a summer internship at a recognized enterprise \nin your target field This will become your first resume entry and if you can get that it will shine\n Y ou generally do not want to lie on your resume But if you are going to lie about some skill or \nsome experience you better be sure you can answer interview questions around that topic or \nyou will be embarrassed and chances are you wont win that role\n Prepare They are going to ask you hard questions during interviews and it is best to have \ncanned responses Some questions Ive had in interviews are the following\n What was the toughest problem you faced and how did you solve it\n What are the steps to bring a requirement to production\n What was the architecture of a recent project Be prepared to drill down and discuss very \nspecific details Talk less about the specific project and more about your contribution to it \nTalk about how you made it better\n Ask questions about the role\n What is the hardest problem you are facing today and what problems do you expect to solve \nin the near future\n What do I need to do to get an Exceeds Expectations rating\n Dont view a rejection as a failure They say Thomas Edison tested 1600 materials for the \nlightbulb filament before he came upon tungsten When they asked him how it felt to fail 1600 \ntimes he said he never failed but succeeded in finding 1600 materials that dont work If you \nare rejected after an interview consider it an opportunity to refine your technique Prepare \nanswers to the questions you were asked so that you will be less nervous when you encounter \nthem in your next interview\n Subscribe for job alerts but when you see them dont apply through thirdparty sites  rather \ngo to the hiring job board directly\n Keep good notes on the jobs you applied for\n If you are getting rejections think about revising your resume\n Use your free time to study It is well worth the money invested in a Udemy personal license\n Nowadays interviewers expect you to solve very difficult algorithms in live coding HackerRank \nor CoderPad sessions If you are great at algorithms you are all set For the rest of us I would Interviews\n 245\nsuggest spending a lot of time practicing But at some point just become familiar with the \nimportant data structures List Map Set Stack Priority Queue and so on When you are asked \nto solve an algorithm think about those structures and think about which would be the best fit\nWhen I am interviewing candidates I always ask this as the final question What makes you great \nand why should I hire you\nWhen you get that question remember the acronym  ACT  which stands for\n Achievements  tell them about specific accomplishments you have delivered\n Capabilities  tell them about your specific skills\n Transferable skills  tell them how your skills can be transferred to their business\nBut the most important advice I can give is to prepare and study Look at the technological requirements \nof the role and invest days and weeks in learning these If you are not employed you have plenty of \nfree time to study Do not squander it\nWellington Rosa\nWellington Rosa shares his experience in building relationships with communities and software \ndevelopers including impacts events and success cases\nQ Tell us how it all started  your professional trajectory in the field of community and software \ndeveloper relations\nA Over the years I have had the opportunity to work in this fascinating area building meaningful \nconnections and fostering mutual growth My professional journey in this industry started with a \npassion for the social aspects of technology Caring about people and improving my connections \nled me down this path early on I realized the transformative power that communities and software \ndevelopers could exert I joined an innovative company where I had the opportunity to dive head\nfirst into this universe and develop relationship communication leadership and networking skills\nQ Can you highlight when you have participated in important events and technical meetings and \nshare some success stories that have shaped your career\nA Over the years I have had the honor of participating in several events and technical meetings \nrelevant to the industry and in all of them I had the opportunity to make important connections that \nhave helped me evolve throughout this journey These experiences were fundamental to expanding my \nknowledge establishing valuable connections and contributing to the dissemination of knowledge \nIll highlight some of these moments in my current companyBe a Leader Manage Up Down and Across Your Organization 246\n The opportunity to design work in the best format and connect with developers inside and \noutside the company This included the creation of an internal committee in a multidisciplinary \nstructure to design the organizational chart The result of all this was contact and relationships \nwith other professionals from other large companies as well as leaders of software communities\n The opportunity to develop and strengthen internal actions with a presentation of the \nimprovements that this type of action would add to the business This involved the indiscriminate \ninvolvement of professionals from all hierarchical levels\n Launching and being involved in the internal strategy for the entire company and getting \napproval of the strategy from the public\nDuring my career I have had the opportunity to experience moments of great impact and significant \nachievements Some success stories that have shaped my career include the following\n Developers advocate internal  A concise description of a project where the main objective was \nto show the importance of this group within the company It was basically a success because \nwe had an approach of notifying the top management of the company of the main alerts and \nshowed improvements in the results We got approval and support to give sequences in external \nactions with greater access to resources and funds\n I hit the car of the VP of the company  Arriving at the company for a meeting at 0830 and \nwith a very tight deadline as I maneuvered my vehicle I hit the side of the car of an employee \nThe valet arrived and advised that it was the VPs car and they did not know what to do After \nidentifying whose car it was I went up to their floor and calmly asked whether he would be \ndriving home He laughingly said Y es  and I said Today you will need to go by Uber  I told \nhim that I had already taken the necessary steps to fix it but that I wouldnt have a spare car \nAt that moment I told him a little bit about what we were doing in the area with the group of \ndevelopers and how this would affect the business It opened the door to a relationship and he \nbecame one of the main sponsors of the initiative inside and outside the company\n Campus party event  We were at a moment of growth in our strategy and it was identified \nthat participation in a very large event would be important to consolidate our work As we \nalready had the door open to contact a VP  we went to the general manager and showed him \nhow important this action would be for the company as well as his position as a representative \nof the brand We explained what we could do including being offered the main stage at the \nevent We received approval and the event happened which became a major milestone for the \ncompany particularly  among the younger public We gained strength and visibility especially \nthrough the figure of the person responsible for BrazilSummary\n 247\nQ Is there anything else you can share\nA My professional trajectory in relationships I have built with communities and software developers \nhas been full of learning enriching experiences and impactful moments Since the beginning I \nhave been motivated by a passion for technology and the desire to build bridges between people and \nknowledge By participating in events and technical meetings I have had the chance to improve myself \nand expand my horizons Moreover the success stories along the way have shown me the power of \nengagement and collaboration I am excited to continue this journey and contribute more and more \nto the growth and development of communities\nThe other important point is that in situations where I have observed that relationships are needed I \nhave always managed to get closer and establish better contacts and relationships within the company \nand outside the company especially treating anyone regardless of their position  treating all hierarchical \nlevels  as equals I have become more respected and listened to In all interactions I try to align my \ncommunication with each person In addition whenever I participate in conversations both internal \nand external to the company I try to discover through social networks connections in things that \nwe have in common This approach facilitates the creation of empathy and improves relationships \nfor future initiatives\nSummary\nIn this chapter you learned how to communicate for impact up down and across the organization \nincluding how to take a leadership attitude act as a

how to find ways to get involved on a deeper level14\nStepping Up Y our Technology \nGame  Defining Technology \nInstead of Merely Using It\nOnce you are leading your career and are helping people around you to transform their lives you can \ninvest in growing your career by impacting the technologies that you use This has the potential to \ntransform the lives of millions of developers around the globe and will also help you grow inside your \ncompany and give you the visibility to grow outside of your company This chapter will show you how\nWe will discuss the following in this chapter\n How technology is standardized and what it has to do with your career\n Identifying technologies and organizations Learning about your programming language  how \nit is standardized the basics the features the classes predefined libraries and functions the \nthreading model the intricacies of the language and the ecosystem\n Getting involved with standards organizations  the conventions and best practices and common \nlibraries and frameworks used in the language\n Aligning your company with standards identifying technologies and organizations and getting \ninvolved on a deeper level\nLets get started\nHow technology is standardized and what it has to do \nwith your career\nTechnical skills  are required to participate in standards organizations but there are many other things \nyou need to know and can learn through participating in standardization activities One of these Stepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 250\nthings is that there are hundreds of ways of doing the same thing When you start getting involved \nin standardization activities and participating in the discussions you will see this through learning \nabout how others use the standards\nOnce there is a standard defined you will see that your first solution proposal will probably not \nrun in production the first time and you will learn the importance of testing and writing tests and \ntest automation to enable standards to be widely adopted and used Y ou will learn that even though \nwriting code for new features and working on greenfield projects is exciting there is so much more \ninvolved in the evolution of a standard  you will need to maintain existing builds and projects and \nevolve and fix bugs  not just for the benefit of your own project but for the other tens hundreds \nmillions or billions of projects\nThis will require developing patches backporting and debugging  essential skills for a senior technical \nprofessional at any level And to be able to evolve to this point in your career you will need to learn \nteamwork this requires also some of those skills we talked about earlier in this book and if you are \nmaintaining a project how to use some specialized tools to evolve projects by branching merging \nand resolving conflicts\nStandards have the unique ability to empower interoperability enable choice and portability and \nprovide developers and customers with the flexibility they need to create solutions for their enterprise \nindependent of development licensing or delivery method Standards are relevant to customers of \nvarying sophistication across all levels of the market  from developers to end users Some of the \nproperties of standards include the following\n Are developed through a defined collaborative process in which all interested parties may participate\n Use varying mechanisms to license associated intellectual property  across a spectrum of \ncosts and obligations\n Regularize interfaces across varying products to achieve compatibility or interoperability \nleaving the specifics of implementation up to developers\n Exist on a spectrum  specification development activities can be more or less open\nAt times standards can be confused with open source We talked about open source participation \nearlier in this book While both are complementary tools used in modern technology environments \nthey are different and not directly comparable but there is a relation and similarity in participation \nThe following are some differentiations\nStandards do not require open source  specifications can be implemented under various development \nand licensing models\nStandards are essential for open source Without standards open source software would struggle to \nprovide interoperability when unable to implement proprietary standards that require royalty payments \nor have other restrictive termsIdentifying the technologies and organizations\n 251\nStandards implemented in open source code can help developers understand the technology and \nincrease open standards adoption One leading example of this practice is the developer adoption \nof Java offering an open source implementation of the technology and related development tools\nTechnology is standardized by bringing together a set of users companies institutions and individuals \nwho want to use or currently use technology in different ways One way a more traditional way to \ndevelop a standard is to define how a type of technology should be used for example cloud computing \nA set of companies from various countries and industries agrees to standardize and then raises and \nforms a group in a standards organization to develop the terminology specifications and technology \nto define it Traditional standards organizations such as ISO W3C OASIS and so on all have their \nown sets of policies and procedures to follow in the development process of a standard They work \ntogether to develop the specification or standard and then they adopt the standard using code to \ndevelop their solutions\nAnother way to develop  standards is to start with an existing technology If there is enough interest in \nthe industry to establish a standard for that technology which will often start as an open source project \nthen the competitors come together to evolve the technology and write a standard and documentation \nsuch as specifications around that existing technology\nA third example is more of a de facto  standard where a company may donate some technology code \nor APIs to a standards organization and then other companies and organizations begin to adopt that \ntechnology leading eventually to it becoming a de facto or de jure standard\nIdentifying the technologies and organizations\nY ou can identify the  standards organizations to get involved with by taking an inventory of the \ntechnologies that you are using Take a look at your development environment and your development \nstack Learn about your programming language  how it is standardized the basics the features the \nclasses predefined libraries and functions the threading model the intricacies of the language and \nthe ecosystem\nLearn about the software and hardware you are using There are inevitably some components that are \nbased on standardized architecture APIs and specifications\nInvestigate which technologies you might be implementing or using as a solution in the future There \nmay be technologies you want to use that are based on a standard Learning about the standard will \nsometimes take longer than learning about the technology but once you identify the technology you \ncan go deeper into learning how that technology is developed and which organizations are involved\nY ou can be viewed as a leader in this area inside of your company by taking the time to understand the \ndynamics at play by learning how the technology evolves and who is responsible for that evolution \nInvestigate the licenses and the Intellectual Property  IP flow Take the time to find out the costs \nof participating and contributing to the standards and what the process and costs of participating at \nvarious levels are Many standards organizations are feebased so this is important information to Stepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 252\nbe able to convey to your management Assess whether any fees are worth the investment balanced \nagainst your ability to influence the standards\nThere are many benefits to software and hardware products that conform to standards including \ninteroperability portability longevity stability and compatibility Be prepared to communicate those \nbenefits along with a comprehensive assessment of your potential involvement in the standard\nGetting involved with standards organizations  the \nconventions and best practices\nThe first thing you  should do to start participating in standards is to determine your role Will you \nplan to lead this effort or are you looking to contribute or just to observe Are you there to monitor \ninfluence or drive Is this effort going to be longterm and strategic or a shortterm engagement\nAs we discussed there are many benefits to participating in standards  finding out the latest developments \npreventing unfavorable or bad things from happening getting crossindustry perspectives on issues \nand encouraging collaboration and innovation Standards activities can influence standards important \nto you or your company\nThere are also perceptionrelated advantages to participating in standards such as communications \nmarketing and mindshare increases in the market Remember that standards participation is a twoway \nstreet standards influence products and products influence standards\nIn addition to technical standards there are increasing standards around interoperability portability \ncompliance regulation and sovereignty issues Standards bodies are probably an unfamiliar environment \nfor you different from your technical or community participation activities They are sometimes \ndescribed as a technical and political activity They are not typically operating with a topdown \nhierarchy and decisionmakers There are new processes not just related to code or engineering There \nare politics meetings motions and Roberts Rules of Order to follow Many standards organizations \nfollow or loosely follow Roberts Rules of Order\nRoberts Rules of Order is a manual of procedures for governance It was created in 1876 by Henry \nMartyn Robert He wrote it as an application of the rules and motions used in the United States \nCongress Y ou can read the rules online  httpsrobertsrulesorgrobertsrules\npdf  or purchase a book describing them to become more familiar with them\nSome of the other principles in play that you will need to be able to adapt to include balancing short\nterm and longterm objectives establishing influence for continued participation and longterm \ninfluence in an organization Y ou will need to build good working relationships with people working \nin other companies and in other geographies Y ou may disagree with them at times but it is vital to \ndo so without being disagreeable This is where your conflict resolution skills will be useful as well \nas your emotional intelligenceGetting involved with standards organizations  the conventions and best practices\n 253\nFor standards development organization meetings there will be a mix of facetoface  F2F meetings  \nand virtual meetings and you should attend in person whenever possible Much like the usefulness \nof office chance conversations in standards organizations there are also these types of hallway \nconversations that happen at standards organizational meetings\nIn addition there are many social hours and meals  lunches dinners and breakfasts  providing such \nopportunities during facetoface or inperson meetings Strengthening your personal relationships \nwill allow you to create influence and form strong relationships and in addition to the formally \nscheduled meetings this will require a mix of direct phone calls emails and both groupprivate \nconversations in person and online Y ou will need these relationships to give and receive feedback \non ideas and proposals Also it will give you the ability to understand why everyone including you \nis participating and the objectives and goals of participants\nBringing together the disparate viewpoints of others and understanding the strategies tactics and \nrisks that exist needs to be managed carefully Y ou should coordinate internally within your company if \nmultiple business units are represented Y ou will need to negotiate and compromise to resolve conflicts \nand create collaborations so the better you understand your holistic strategy the easier this will be \nfor you to do Remember that you do not have to satisfy every use case It may be helpful to keep in \nmind that with standards development timeliness is important If the window of opportunity is lost \nand no one implements the standard it is not useful Y ou will need to differentiate between critical \nimportant or nicetohave elements\nThere are several possible paths to choose from when you are trying to come to a resolution and reconcile \nthe needs of various participants Some options include waiting for the next version of the standard \nrelying on building blocks or a Lego bricks style of evolution  layering multiple specifications or \nextensions standard or proprietary When you meet with other groups internally ask them whether \nit will have a significant impact on servicesproducts present or future\nThere is an advantage to leadership in standards organizations Advantages of leadership include the \nability to influence technical decisions strategic direction the timing of standard development and \nthe pace and direction of the evolution of the standards Leadership is useful for longterm interest in a \nstandard or an organization Be advised that leadership can lead to a potential conflict of interest  be \nmindful of that possibility It is important to keep trust in the fairness of the process and the presence \nof a level playing field This can be a challenge treating everyone fairly within standard processes while \nnot undercutting your own interests When there are particularly controversial issues if possible \nhaving a different employee team member represent a different point of view can help preserve the \nother positions that you may have taken in the organization\nIf you do decide to take a leadership role in a standards organization ensure that you know how to write \na design and specification document  you can learn this by reviewing existing ones Y ou will need to \nlearn how to incorporate feedback and move to resolution quickly in these documents Y ou will also \nneed to know how to run meetings efficiently stay on track with an agenda and hear viewpoints from \ndifferent participants in the meeting Y ou can practice running meetings in your development team to \nstart and practice resolving conflicts in the meeting Y ou should learn how to influence another team Stepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 254\nmember or team to use your solutions Practice mentoring and modeling behaviors you would like to \nsee emulated in your team and across your organization Learn how to lead a project to completion \nand how to explain your viewpoints to others who may not have a technical background Often in \nstandards organizations there is a mix of technical and nontechnical individuals\nThere are varying methodologies incorporated into standardsetting organizations or standards\nrelated organizations They will typically have a development approach that includes transparency \nparticipation regulations licensing and Intellectual Property Rights  IPRs \nIn addition to languages and frameworks there are common libraries that are part of language \necosystems which may also be standardized or developed as open source projects Often there is \nsynergy between standards and open source projects When you decide to participate in standards \nactivities it is helpful to learn from some of the standards that have a history of successful collaboration \nand adoption of the standards\nDrawing on our extensive experience in the Java ecosystems there are some best practices when doing \nso that we have gleaned These are summarized in the following list\n Ensure that there is a  wide range of contributors not only corporations but also individuals \nand educational or nonprofit groups such as user groups or open source groups who are \ninterested in contributing to and adopting the standard\n Involve the broader community early in the standardization process Include and gather input \non the functionality as well as specific features that are required in the standards\n Create an open and collaborative culture among the participants and ensure that the standards \nbody operates openly and transparently  communications issue trackers and development \nshould be out in the open\n It is essential to have open feedback mechanisms for user feedback as the standards are being \ndeveloped and after they are finalized to ensure future versions incorporate how the technology \nis being used and also to allow for requests for support and new features\n Allow and encourage multiple implementations of the standards and flexibility in the licensing\n Allow the standard and the implementation to be developed concurrently and in the open\n Streamline the processes for standardization to embrace current software development \nmethodologies such as agile and continuous deliverytrunk development\n Develop test suites to validate the conformity of multiple implementations of the standard\n Y ou should become familiar with not only the standardization process but also the ecosystem \nof development for the frameworks and libraries developed to support the language\nWhen you decide to get involved in a standards organization remember the reason you are participating \nand be mindful of whether you are there for your personal interests or whether you are participating \non behalf of your company The purpose and role should guide your participation in the organization \nNow let us talk about connecting your company to standardsConnecting your company to standards identifying technologies and organizations and getting involved on a deeper level\n 255\nConnecting your company to standards identifying \ntechnologies and organizations and getting involved on \na deeper level\nOnce you have started contributing to a standardization effort it is  often necessary to bring your \ncompany into the  effort in order to have maximum impact Assuming  you start as an observer versus \na participant in a standards activity the first thing to do is educate yourself and become familiar with \nthe standard and the organization as well as how you think your company products currently could \nuse the standard Review the current discussions and issues to become acquainted with some of the \ncurrent considerations being contemplated in the next release or version of the standard\nThe next step in this process is to have a conversation with your management and discuss some of your \nideas about how your company can contribute together Y ou can also find the contacts at your company \nto discuss this with within other product or development organizations and also whether there are \nprocedural contacts in place Many companies either have an office in the Chief Technology Officer  \nCTO  or architecture group dedicated to standards andor open source Sometimes you can also find \ncontacts via a legal representative Ensure that you have the proper agreement on your participation \nand then you can pursue formalized membership in the organization or perhaps contributions at a level \nbefore membership Typically organizations have and should have a contributor license agreement  \nCLA  in place which you should also discuss with your legal contract before agreeing to any terms\nAfter you receive the approval to participate it is a good practice to find other people in your organization \ninterested in the standard and solicit their feedback and contributions\nSometimes people are busy and may not respond to your requests but try to be patient Be direct \nand clear with your requests for feedback and provide a clear date by which you would like to receive \nany feedback from them\nIf you receive feedback that needs clarification or there is any contradicting feedback it is often helpful \nto set up a brief meeting to discuss and resolve how to move forward representing your company as \na whole\nStart contributing to the standard projects based on these positions and look for opportunities to \nadvance your company in the standards organization This could be through working groups executive \nboards expert groups contributions or evangelizing the work to the public\nProvide interim drafts to your colleagues internally and solicit their feedback again\nIt will be important to contribute the agreed feedback or input but also to ensure there is agreement \non how it was incorporated and whether there are second third and fourthround comments \nEncourage others to experiment with the standard or implementation and provide feedback that you \ncan incorporate These steps will expedite your company and its ability to develop its own products \nand implementations of the standards more quickly and easily This allows the solutions to be out in \nthe marketplace with customers much sooner as wellStepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 256\nWhen you have successfully contributed to a standards activity make sure to communicate and share \nthe results with everyone in your team who has provided feedback or comments This is also a good \ntime to investigate whether there could be mention of the activity in a blog or press release Y ou can \ncheck with your communications or public relations contacts usually in the marketing department This \nwill ensure that your company leadership role and your own contributions are impact are highlighted\nIn summary you should learn how the standards organization works and the processes for moving \nfrom different roles such as  observer to participant member author editor reviewer leader and \nso on Observe and find mentors and sponsors  and grow your network of connections inside the \norganization Communicate your intentions to contribute to the organization and decide on actions \nto take Follow up on your commitments and responsibilities

and making an impact\nInterview\nEd Burns\nQ Hi Ed Burns Why dont you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your current role\nA My current role as well talk about is a happy extension of my previous roles\nI work at Microsoft and I am the principal architect overseeing how Jakarta EE runtimes can find \na home on Azure In this role I work with partnerships with the three main commercial Java app \nserver vendors that are still producing wellused products IBM Red Hat and Oracle These vendors \nare responsible for multimilliondollar accounts in the world of running Java EE workloads They \nrun critical Java EE workloads for all sectors of the economy from finance to energy technology \nand communications\nWeve got customers that are doing all of these things and they have workloads that they want to \ncontinue to derive corporate value from by moving them into the cloud Moreover they want to do so \nin a way that lets them capitalize on the cloud value proposition of transparency expenditure and the \nscalability of workloads so that youre not really leaving any money on the table with regard to runtimes\nQ Y ou have a vast amount of experience Tell us a little bit about how you got started and how you \ngot to where you are now in a highlevel role at Microsoft\nA Well the thing that I like to realize is what I call the magic triad right place right time right skills \nSome of that is luck some of it is preparedness and some of it is being able to see an opportunity\nThere were two moments in my career where that happened The first was in college I happened to \nbe a student at the University of Illinois in UrbanaChampaign as an undergrad in the early 1990s \nand managed to get involved as a student programmer in NCSA Mosaic which was the worlds first \ngraphical web browser When I graduated in 1995 there were not that many people in the world Interview\n 257\nat that time that were able to do HTML understood what HTML authoring was understood what \nHTTP and web servers were and knew how to do Unix socket programming and other web browser \nbasics It was simple stuff back then HTTP1 and 09 textbased protocols nothing like HTTP2 or \nHTTP3 being worked on now But anyhow that was one opportunity\nLater J2EE was invented The early stages of J2EE were what is now known as Tomcat and that was \ntwo specifications Servlet and JSP  Servlet was a Java wrapper around CGIbin  which was the HTTP \ntechnology whose birth I had witnessed in my undergrad days JSP was based on a Microsoft idea \nActive Server Pages The combination of these things was the first example of a sweet spot for being \nable to make a moneymaking valuedelivering Java application that worked on the web\nWith that you had the concept of a framework and so one of the early frameworks that combined \nServlet and JSP was Struts Struts was set up by Craig McClanahan He was hired by Sun and I joined \nhim to work on a specification to create a standard for doing a web framework thing This is what \nbecame JavaServer Faces\nThrough my work on JavaServer Faces I became more deeply involved in J2EE Jakarta EE and Java \nEE The key value proposition of this open standard is to empower developers by giving them a core \nset of APIs that ensures that their skills are portable and not locked into any one vendors ecosystem\nOne of the interesting things I got to see happen was the essential forking of the early version of J2EE \ninto what became Spring Being able to have a historical perspective of how these two ecosystems \ndiverged and observe the levels of commercial success that they both have in comparison to each \nother is something thats really interesting\nQ Definitely Y ou had the opportunity to work at Sun Microsystems Oracle and Microsoft Tell us \na story about your career and specifically a moment where you felt like you made an impact based \non the work that you did and your involvement with standards where it really made a difference in \nterms of your career and visibility or where you felt like you were truly making a difference in the \nwork that you were doing\nA Well looking back on the very rewarding history I had with JSF I tried to bring humility and \ncommunity to the work and embrace the notion of This is a community project so I want to bring \nas many people in as possible \nOne moment was at JavaOne in maybe 2008 I was approached by two Austrian gentlemen and they \nsaid Were excited to meet you Mr Burns  in a nice Austrian accent They said Were working on a \ncleanroom open source implementation of the JSF spec  I replied Thats great We want to get you \non the expert group We want to get your ideas and make sure that were developing the new version \nof the spec in a way that is helpful \nAt the time being able to be a member of JCP  which is the standard body that was doing the spec \nwasnt as easy for noncorporate members Over the years JCP became much more accepting of \ncommitters coming in from the outside and that process has continued to the point that now Jakarta Stepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 258\nEE is the standard body overseeing the continued development of this technology They have a range \nof participants and so does JCP individuals Java User Group members and corporations These \ngentlemen came to me and said Were building an independent implementation of the JSF spec  \nand instead of seeing them as competition I was able to say Great  the more the merrier We need \nto have more people to test out the spec \nThat became MyFaces That was the key runtime for JSF in IBM and a lot of corporate implementations \nused that To this day there are still two main implementations of JSF\nQ Y ou were basically famous in the ecosystem These people you d never met sought you out and were \nobviously eager and excited to meet you but you actually had an impact on their business\nA Right Heres another moment or impact I wanted to talk about and its one I take real pride in\nI believe that much of computing as it was from the very beginning is all about automating things \nand creating the opportunity for people to create more value faster Unfortunately the pace of that \ninnovation has often outstripped peoples abilities to adapt and learn to ride that crest\nWhat effectively ends up happening with computing is that yes there are more opportunities but the \nnumber of hands that can actually reap those benefits is increasingly shrinking Now the fruit is out \nthere Y ou can pick it up off the tree but its getting harder and harder and the pace is moving ever \nfaster People who work in computing could reasonably be tagged as job destroyers thats one way of \nthinking about it If youre an optimist you might say No were not job destroyers Were job creators \nbecause were creating innovation that enables human beings to do more \nIve talked with leaders about this and I see both sides but in practice its more of the jobdestroying \nthats happening But the case of JSF was a bit of a golden spot where instead of automating and \ndestroying jobs I actually was able to observe people creating companies  building JSF component \nlibraries doing consulting and so on As I mentioned the company that did MyFaces built a very \nsuccessful consulting business on top of it and it is still operating to this day Because of the openness \nof the standard I was able to be a steward and crank the wheel to produce a small and moneymaking \necosystem of a lot of different companies some of which have gone bust some of which have dissolved \nand some of which still exist\nI feel proud of that  its not easy to do as a corporate individual contributor I am not a startup \nperson I have always worked for a big company so Im lucky that I was able to have the chance to do \nthat while still having the security of a big steady corporate paycheck\nQ Right  you had that impact as well as building on your network Y ou have the opportunity to do \nthat from inside a large company working as an engineer\nY ou started out at Sun Microsystems and you progressed to the senior levels How do you think your \nwork as a technical leader being involved in the standard and defining the standard for JSF helped \nyour career and your progressionInterview\n 259\nA Thats a good question Theres a key characteristic of working on a project that is an open source \nproject the implementation and interface are in one project Theres only so much scale you can get \nbecause the work youre doing is going to stay in that project\nHowever if you work on an open standard such as the Java EE JCP  and Jakarta standards youre going \nto have a wider impact because there are other vendors that are building on using and implementing \nthat specification\nIn the case of JSF and JCP in general I was also involved in one of the iterations of the Servlet \nspecification This was Servlet version 4 which was the one that introduced HTTP2 Earlier I talked \nabout being able to remember when HTTP09 was just a simple textbased protocol with MIME \nheaders compared to HTTP2 when you had socket multiplexing a binary header compression \nprotocol and much more Im very fortunate to have that perspective of things but to come back to \nthe breadth of impact working on standards gives you a bigger breadth of impact but you have to \nbalance that with the corporate model\nThe corporate model for a singlevendor implementation such as Spring is a lot easier for many \ncorporations to absorb because they know they have one vendor to deal with  their one support channel \n whereas if you go with Jakarta EE you have to pick a vendor but with an implicit understanding that \nyou might be able to move to other things so that tradeoff is something to keep in mind\nAt the end of the day I believe the standards give developers and contributors more ability to grow \ntheir careers than a singleecosystem open source project Now there are certainly plenty of examples \nof people who are successful open source committers that contribute to a wide range of different \nthings Look at the Nodejs community Theres TJ Holowaychuk who has written a huge number of \nthe things that are in that community but hes also gone on to do lots of other amazing things and \nother open standards too\nSo its not a hard and fast rule but its easier to be portable with standards\nQ In terms of your career advancement conversations did that come up with your managers when \nit became time to look at moving to the next level\nA Definitely\nThere is a ramp of increasing responsibility that working on standards naturally affords This ramp \nhas a shallow enough slope that your managers at the time as you progress along that ramp can say \nOK you climbed up a few steps Are you still performing well or do you need to tweak something \nIt gives you an opportunity to gradually grow but it doesnt hold you back because if you see that \nyoure able to master the current level you can go faster and further too\nGoing back to the early days of JSF I originally worked just as the implementation guy for the first \nversion of JSF and Craig McClanahan was the main spec lead As the project got further along the \nworkload got more and more challenging and I said I think I d like to offer to be a cospec lead on Stepping Up Your Technology Game  Defining Technology Instead of Merely Using It 260\nthis  He replied Y es OK Lets do that  Then we were able to get the thing done because the scope \nwas getting more and more advanced and we had to close it down and ship it Thats an example of \nwhere I was able to see what the next step was  to go from implementation to spec lead\nQ And then inside the company your level increased as a result of that\nWhen it came to leaving and looking for external positions how do you think your involvement in a \ntechnical standard contributed to your ability to be seen as a strong candidate\nA Well over many years working with JSF JCP  Jakarta EE and Java EE I had interactions with many \nleaders and technical contributors across many different company vendors Back in the time when \ninperson conferences were easier to do right after joining Microsoft I had the opportunity to take \nmy new boss around JavaOne and just introduce her to the community I could say Oh heres so and \nso Theyre the director of engineering for this part of the Java platform  and then have them be able \nto say Oh youve got a good hire there with Ed I know him from this and that  That experience \nwas repeated with a large variety of people I knew from the Java ecosystem just at JavaOne It was \nessentially me telling my new boss Look Im solidifying that you have hired someone who has \nconnections at least \nQ Of course Y ou are a resource that has more to offer than just your technical skills theres more \nto it than that and thats one aspect that you brought to your role with your experience in technical \nstandards defining the standard\nDo you want to talk a little bit about becoming an author and some of the books that youve written \nand your experience with that\nA Sure Theres a story there too and it goes back to being able to spot when someone is struggling \nwith their task and effectively help them but also in a way that helps yourself\nI mentioned observing that Craig needed help getting the JSF spec done One of the conferences I \nwas at was one that no longer exists  it was called The Server Side Java Symposium I was already \ninvolved in JSF at that time and I went to The Server Side Java Symposium It was held at Caesars \nPalace in Las Vegas and somehow there was this little white baby grand piano that was sitting at the \ntop of an escalator\nIt was a late night There was some party I think Mike CannonBrookes and Hani Suleiman were \nthere drinking cocktails Anyway there was this piano I sat down It was late No one was around \nI started just tinkling along on this piano and this guy came up to me and said Oh I play  He sat \ndown next to me and we played a little together\nIt turned out he was this guy Christian Schalk from Oracle and he also knew me as the JSF guy but \nhe had been signed up to write a book about JSF with McGraw Hill As it turned out his former \ncoauthor had left the project and he needed another coauthor That was how I got involved in my Summary\n 261\nfirst technical book just being open to it and recognizing an opportunity There again it is the right \nplace right time right skills\nQ Right Then you went on to write several other books\nWell thanks so much for sharing your career stories\nSummary\nIn this chapter you learned how to make a plan to get involved in standards organizations how to \nchoose a few organizations to participate in to get started how to join and participate in the process \nhow to bring the concerns of your company and team into the process and how to find ways to get \ninvolved on a deeper level\nNext lets continue the discussion on making an impact in your technical career path by discussing \nhow to build your personal brand and unlock the secrets to being respected and requested as a \ntrusted advisor15\n Build Y our Personal Brand and \nBecome a Trusted Advisor\nAs we conclude part three of this book you will use all of the skills you have acquired so far to build \nyour personal brand Y ou are helping and transforming peoples lives and this builds trust in you \nY our personal brand will allow you to expand this trust to more people help you attract people to your \nprojects and initiatives and position you as a highachieving respected professional This chapter will \nhelp you use all you have done up to now to position your brand in the market When talking about \npersonal branding the first thing that comes to mind is the following Do I need this Do I have to \nbuild my own personal brand I dont like to selfpromote so why should I even have a brand\nThe reality is everyone has a brand Y ou already have your brand The question is do you have control \nover what people believe about you See the interview with Y olande later in this chapter Further \nyour core values create a strong personal brand Y our values communicate who you are who you want \nto become and why employers colleagues friends and partners choose you Try to narrow down \nyour core values to 5 or 10 points that communicate the things most authentic to you Y ou can start \nwith a larger list and then select the ones that help focus and exemplify your brand  not only who \nyou are now but who you want to become in the future Some examples of values are the following\n Agility\n Accuracy\n Autonomy\n Collaboration\n Efficiency\n Excellence\n Duty\n Fun Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 264\n Generosity\n Growth\n Honesty\n Independence\n Innovative\n Integrity\n Perseverance\n Resourcefulness\n Responsibility\n Security\n Service\nTake the time to make an inventory of your values as you start to think about developing your \npersonal brand\nThus in our quest to create our own brand we will cover the following in this chapter\n What is personal branding\n How to build your professional brand\n How to attract an audience\n How to leverage your personal brand professionally\nSo lets begin\nWhat is personal branding\nWe covered storytelling  earlier in the book and to be effective in communicating your personal brand \nyou are going to need to leverage those skills to share both your personal brand and those stories we \ntalked about developing Throughout your career if you have developed an authentic personal brand \nand you stay true to it and you consistently and effectively communicate your brand messages you \nwill build trust and establish a lasting personal and professional brand that can provide opportunities \nfor career growth advancement and recognition Lets start by understanding some of the elements \nof personal branding\nBuilding trust\nWe live in a society thats based  on trust We trust that our company is going to pay our salaries Our \ncompany trusts that were going to work and build the software Our customers trust that were going What is personal branding\n 265\nto deliver highquality software that will solve their problems Our customers and all our stakeholders \ntrust that companies and developers will use their data in the right way and not misuse their data\nEspecially in the context of jobs the best way to get an amazing job be it in your company or any \nother company is to have people trust you When people trust you they believe that youre going to \ndo good work and that you will be competent skillful focused and loyal\nThe best positions in the market are given to people that we trust At some point in the past you have \nlikely recommended someone to your company whom you deeply trusted or perhaps even hired \nthem on your own team\nResearch shows that up to 75 of positions are filled through referrals which is an indication of the \nimportance of trust If you want to get an amazing role you need to be trusted by someone and get \ninvited to apply for this position\nGaining reputation\nWe need to think about the factors  that contribute to our reputation Reputation  is what people believe \nabout you Thus reputation is something that depends on what people see and believe youre capable \nof doing We should keep in mind that reputation and trust while very similar are not the same thing \nWe can however use them interchangeably in many situations While trust can be understood at a \nbroader level reputation tends to have more specific consequences for your career growth and for \nyou personally as well They are similar concepts that we can talk about in a similar way with regard \nto careers in general Reputation is what people believe about you And if people trust you you have \na good reputation If people dont trust you its probably  because you dont have a good reputation\nIncreasing visibility\nOne important thing about this is that for people  to believe something about you they have to know \nyou They have to have heard of you somehow We need to determine what makes us visible in our \ncompany and the market at large The fact is that we are responsible for our own visibility We do not \nneed to rely on others to create our own brand for us We shape and determine our brand and we \ndetermine how visible we are Perception is how others perceive our brand  that is outside of our \ncontrol but perception is based on how we visibly portray our brand\nThose three concepts trust reputation and visibility are extremely important They go hand in hand \nAgain theyre not the same thing but they work together to position you in the market\nY our brand is the combination of how visible you are how trustworthy you are and your reputation \namong people\nThat is what a brand is A brand is not a logo or a name or a website  although all of these can be \nused together to build a good brand for yourself So if people know who you are trust you and believe \nsomething good about you they might come to your website and read more of what you have to say \nThey might come to a presentation or even a workshop or a course that you run They might buy  Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 266\nyour book All of these factors will help in strengthening your reputation and visibility and enable \npeople to trust you\nY our personal brand is the combination of all those assets you possess that show who you are and \nhow you can help other people throughout the world One important thing about branding that we \ndiscuss in more detail in the interview at the end of this chapter is the idea that you can either control \nyour brand and position yourself in the market or other people will position you\nPeople always hold some beliefs about you If they dont know you what they believe about you might \nbe little or no significance If they heard bad things about you they might believe them even if they \nmight not be true\nIf you dont position yourself in the market and control your brand then what happens is that the \nmarket will position you any way it wants And of course people that are not you will never position \nyou as well as you can position yourself\nIf you take a handsoff approach to your brand you leave your reputation in the hands of others Y oure \nnever going to have as good a reputation as you could if you dont exert a level of control\nOf course this control is a limited capability Y ou cannot have full control of your own brand because \npeople do sometimes believe things that might be untrue or wrong They might have only a limited \nidea of what you do They might not see some parts of you For example you might have a great \nreputation as a Java developer but people might not see that what youre really very good at is in the \narea of databases\nBut you do have a certain level of control although the better word might be influence  Y ou can \ninfluence your brand and how people see you in a way that more people will trust you and see who \nyou really are This leads to having a good reputation\nBecoming a trusted advisor\nWhen people  trust you they will undoubtedly listen to your suggestions  and willingly follow your \nrecommendations It could be technical recommendations or it could be which path to follow at a \ncertain moment It could be how to make specific decisions It could be a combination of all of those \nthings If people decide to follow your advice because they trust you thats when you become what \nwe call a trusted advisor \nA trusted advisor is someone who can work collaboratively with their customers and peers to help \nthem make better decisions and achieve the best possible results The importance of being a trusted \nadvisor is that when you work collaboratively you are able to influence much earlier in the process \nthe decisions and paths that people and even organizations take\nWhile a salesperson for example might help someone decide which cloud to acquire or maybe \nwhich language to choose for a specific project a trusted advisor will work with them way before that \ndecision needs to be taken By the time a decision like this has to be made the trusted advisor has What is personal branding\n 267\nalready gained the trust of the customer or company such that they have a much larger influence on \nthe final outcome Y ou can be a trusted advisor for your team your friends your company and your \nmanagement Y ou can be that person that is working collaboratively early on in the process in such \na way that you have the highest possible influence on future decisions And that again opens up all \nkinds of amazing possibilities and opportunities to get jobs that give you high levels of autonomy \nand influence It gets you working on the types of projects that you really want to work on instead of \nbeing at the mercy of circumstances  you are going to be the person guiding and helping others to \ndecide what the environment will look like\nThere are several ways  that you can become a trusted advisor many of which are discussed  in this book \nin specific chapters that you can refer to Let us mention them here briefly to help you understand \nhow each of these positions can be a stepping stone toward becoming a trusted advisor\nBeing a community builder\nOne way to become  a trusted advisor is to become a community builder A community builder is \nsomeone who is responsible for getting a group of people to work together toward a common goal \nCommunity  is a broad term that can apply to your team in your company It can also be something \nbroader such as a public community for example a user group a technology user group a meet\nup or an event There are all kinds of communities that can be built The community builder helps \neveryone make connections and get acquainted and understands the pros and cons of decisions for \nthe whole team\nAnd so being a community builder is an amazing position because you become the trusted advisor \nfor a whole group of people And the fact that when you have one person that reflects in the whole \ngroup and that increases the trust that people have in you increasing your reputation in turn And \nbecause it is a community such a position naturally also increases your visibility a lot\nBeing a contributor\nAnother possibility and we talk  a lot about this when we speak about open source technologies is for \nyou to become a contributor A contributor is someone who contributes to the success of a project or \ninitiative Y ou can contribute to open source projects initiatives at your company and public initiatives \nsuch as user groups or events As a contributor and trusted advisor you are part of the process Y oure \nnot simply someone responsible just for doing an activity you become part of the organizations story \nand its pursuit of its goals The more you contribute to an activity the more trust youll have from \neveryone else on the team and the more influence youll have over the decisionmaking process\nAs an example if you participate in an open source project but are just a sporadic contributor that just \ncontributes from time to time you might gain some responsibilities but the people in the project are \nnot going to trust you to be there constantly The more you get involved and the more contributions \nyou make to the project the more trust you earn and the better the reputation you will develop When \nyou have more influence you can  start making decisions about the architecture of the project new \nversions and new initiatives Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 268\nBeing a publisher creator or influencer\nAnother way you can become a trusted advisor  is by creating your own content  that is being a \npublisher creator or influencer Instead of you working with people to get something done you \nbecome a trusted advisor via this route because you have the knowledge and you share that knowledge \nthrough content such as blogs videos or presentations\nWe have mentioned being a creator in many chapters in this book in particular being a publisher This \nallows you to gain influence and become a trusted advisor to the largest amount of people possible \ngoing far beyond a single team and even beyond your company The larger a publisher you are the \nmore people in the industry will trust you and come to see you as a trusted advisor and your reputation \nwill grow accordingly in your industry One important concept here is that building your personal \nbrand allows you to position yourself as a publisher A publisher is someone that has an audience \nWhether you call it being a publisher a creator or an influencer it means having an audience   You  \nhave people that trust you and see you as their trusted advisor seeking you out for your content on \nthat particular type of information or technology Note also that having this kind of influence over \nsuch a large amount of people does come with high levels of responsibility\nIt can be extremely rewarding to take this path of being a publisher because it allows you to help a lot \nof people to achieve better results transform their lives and even help other people in turn\nBeing a mentor\nAnother type  of trusted advisor and we have a full chapter specifically about this in this book is to \nbe a mentor A mentor is someone who works closely with their mentees to help them overcome their \nchallenges and obstacles and achieve better results As a mentor your level of responsibility grows \nbecause now youre working specifically with people on their personal dreams and goals and helping \nthem achieve and advance further Its also extremely rewarding because you get to see the results of \nyour effort and the value of your contribution Y ou can mentor people in your company in your team \nfriends and acquaintances that you meet at events or other people from your industry network Y ou \ncan even be a professional mentor where you open up your services of mentorship for a larger number \nof people or for people that are not in your immediate circle of networking\nBeing a mentor is the highest level of trusted advisor because you are personally and emotionally \nconnected to the people that youre mentoring Y ou are invested in their goals their dreams and \nhelping them achieve the transformation they seek It is an honor to mentor someone Such a position \nshould undoubtedly be taken seriously\nIdentify your professional brand\nTo begin you need to define your vision and purpose  Personally and professionally what values  \nare important to you and how do you want your audience to perceive you How will you make an \nimpact on them What skill sets or experience do you have that distinguish you from others who \nhave these same valuesHow to build your professional brand\n 269\nAssess your personal brand inventory  After you establish your purpose values and skills take an \ninventory of how you are perceived in the industry Take note of your traits habits and characteristics \nMake any adjustments necessary to reflect your current reality\nConstruct a narrative around this inventory  Y ou should branch out to create narratives for basic \nquestions such as Tell me about yourself   Tell me about your resume of experience   Tell me where you \nare from and where you are going   and What makes you special  Use examples from your experience \nto share stories that answer these questions and incorporate your brand inventory characteristics\nOnce you have established and are aware of your unique offering and characteristics you are ready to \nbuild your brand and attract an audience The key here is to be authentic  in living out your personal \nbrand identity  be your brand \nHow to build your professional brand\nLet us now discuss how to build  your professional brand The following subsections cover four steps \nthat are extremely important in building your professional brand\nThe first step is to understand yourself because your brand is already in you A professional brand \nis not something that appears out of the blue Its not something that you decide you want to be or \nbecome It is a construction using everything that you already did and all the reputation you have all \nyour experience and history combined with the things that you want to do in the future Y ou always \nstart from where you are right now  from your skills your projects your experience your visibility \nand the people that youre ready to help\nY ou start from where you are right now  and then you look to the future How do you want to present \nall of this to your audience and your future connections The first step is to understand who you are \nunderstand what you have done and make an assessment of all the projects you have participated in \nand all the skills you have acquired Try to create narratives out of this A great way to create narratives \nis to use the Star methodology \nStar methodology\nThe Star methodology  is a methodology used to create narratives  for interviews All interviewers are \nfamiliar with it and will easily understand it Y ou can also use it to your advantage to organize your \nabilities projects and skills into brief Star narratives allowing you to better understand yourself and \nbuild your brand It works like this by breaking your narrative down into four points\n Situation  Describe what the scenario of the narrative is\n Task  What is the task that you had to do or the problem to be solved in this particular narrative\n Action  What is the action that you took to solve the problem and complete the task\n Result  What is the result that you achieved Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 270\nBy thinking about your narratives in terms of the things that you did and the experience you gained \nand then putting them in this Star format you can develop more clarity and have a better understanding \nof what you can deliver in future roles and explain this in future interviews More broadly it helps  \nyou develop a very clear vision of who  you are how you can help people and how you can really use \nyour reputation to create the brand that you want to build\nDefine your brand in an outwardfocused way\nThe second step is to define  your brand in an outwardfocused way Its very easy to confuse our brand \nwith ourselves  Its my brand its what I do its the things that Im good at We can easily think of our \nbrand as something to do solely with us But your brand is not about you  Y our brand is about how \nyou help others to achieve what they want\nThe best way for you to plan and define your brand is by thinking of what you can help others achieve \nbecause people dont care about your brand your logo or your blog People dont care about us \nPeople care about how you can help them achieve what they want Everyone wants to have or become \nsomething Once you understand the service that your brand will provide and what success looks like \nalong with the results that people will get by being associated with you ie by buying your services \nconnecting with your blog or watching your Y ouTube content thats when you have a clear brand \nthat people will choose to follow Take the phrase  I help people to do X so they can have or become Y  \nIts a very simple phrase that you can use People  here are those that you want to attract to become \nyour audience the people that you want to help X is the thing that you are very good at and that you \nwant to be known for Y is the thing that people want to do have or become\nThis simple formulaic phrase can really help you get clarity on creating an outwardfocused brand \nBy focusing on other people and helping them have or become something they want they choose you \nas the appropriate person for them to associate with They then start to follow you to pay attention to \nyour content to participate more in your initiatives Y ou have now formed relationships and created \nengagement with  your audience\nFigure out how you want to help\nThe next step is to figure out how you want to help This book mentioned many ways that you can help \nyour audience from participating in open source projects to building communities public speaking \nor writing blogs and books All of these techniques help you build a relationship with your audience \nTheres no right or wrong way here as long as you create engagement Y ou can also use social media \nY ouTube audio video or podcasts any way you want to do it Each audience has a different preference \nWhatever technology or means you choose youre going to attract people that are interested in the \nmeans by which you share your content\nOther options include helping your audience by creating courses doing live streams or mentoring \npeople All of these methods are just ways for you to help them achieve success with the results \nthey want The more people get results by being close to you or by being in a relationship with you How can we attract an audience\n 271\nthe more theyre going to trust you and the bigger your reputation will get This is a great way of \ncreating engagement\nBe consistent\nAnother thing thats very important is being consistent One of the most important things in terms of \nbuilding an audience is consistency By consistency we do not mean that we have to share one article \nat 2 P M every week What we mean by consistency is that you are constantly talking to your audience \nconsistently being present A great way to do this is by using social media because you can share a \nsmall piece of content every day Also having conversations either inperson live conversations on \nY ouTube or on a podcast is another great technique because people can have access to you\nShowing up consistently at different events over multiple years is also another way People will soon \nexpect to see you there Any way that your community can see you with a reasonable frequency \nso they can strengthen their relationship with you contributes to building that consistency that is \nfundamental for people to believe that they have a relationship And its these relationships that are \nso important for trust visibility and your reputation The biggest goal of building your brand is to \nbuild these relationships with people One last point that we want to make is that relationships are \nbuilt with people  Even though you might be helping companies to achieve results or helping teams \nto be more productive in the end youre going to be talking and building a relationship with people  \nThey could be managers developers or your peers But you need to be looking for people  to build a \nrelationship with\nHow can we attract an audience\nNow that you see the importance  of being a trusted advisor to your audience the next important step \nis to attract an audience\nBuilding a brand is all about successfully attracting your own audience We are all publishers Our \nexperience is that attracting an audience is something that technical people are afraid of because \ndevelopers and technical people in general are not looking to be celebrities Theyre not trying to \npromote themselves When you start talking about attracting people it always sounds unnecessary \nand doesnt seem to be connected to your career Some people think that this is only for people who \nwant to build a product or something like that\nTake responsibility for helping others  leaders take \nresponsibility\nIn reality attracting an audience  is you taking responsibility for helping other people Think about it \nY ou have the knowledge you have the capacity to mentor people you have the experience the skills \nand all those things can help others to achieve their soughtafter results to be successful to improve \ntheir careers and to improve their lives If you dont take responsibility to work with them how can \nthey ever find you Attracting people means taking this responsibility to find the people that need \nyou and helping them achieve the things that they need Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 272\nLeaders are those that take responsibility so when you take responsibility to help others youre being \na leader Even though that might sound scary and unnecessary it is precisely due to being a leader that \nthis process of building your brand and attracting people to you will have such a large impact on your \ncareer Behaving like a leader will make you more visible and give you a stronger reputation Being \nmore visible in your community will flow into other aspects of your life as well For instance this will \nlend more visibility to your content allowing you to meet a wider range of people and opening up \nmore opportunities for yourself and also for others Y ou will attract more people to the projects and \ncommunities that you are involved in\nIt will also improve you technically because the more people you attract as your audience the more \npeople youre going to have a chance to talk to about your technical topics of interest and the more \nchances youre going to have to get involved in important projects The result  is that you also increase \nyour technical expertise\nYou cant transform people but they can transform themselves\nOnce you realize how you can inspire people to transform  themselves and their careers you will see \nhow it can benefit your own career First you have to understand how to inspire people The most \nimportant thing in terms of attracting people is understanding that you cant transform people People \ntransform themselves\nEvery time you help someone take an action that helps them transform themselves youre being a \nleader to that person Y oure being that leader that not only attracts people but actually helps people \nto take action and transform themselves to do something that will deliver them results The content \nthat we generate be it articles books videos presentations or even training courses  that content \ndoes not change or transform people What really transforms them are the actions that they take once \nthey discover your content Exactly because of that the focus should always be on helping people take \naction The objective of creating content should always be to inspire people to take action We can \ncreate amazing presentations but if at the end of it the person consuming our content is not ready \nto take action then nothing transformative will happen for them\nWe have to recognize that taking action is one of the hardest things for people to do There are all \nkinds of reasons that we use to convince ourselves that we dont need to take action We say things \nlike Oh I dont need this right now   or No its too hard for me to do it Its not going to change my life   \nPeople will create all sorts of excuses to not take action on something that you propose The challenge \nis how can we work with people in a way that we inspire them to take action To do that there are \nfour steps that we should consider\nBuild a better future\nStep number one help them build a better future People will gravitate toward something that they \nwant If they can see that your content or the technology youre proposing can bring them a better \nfuture they will be more inclined to take action So you should always help them build a better future \nfor themselves However you dont need to do this by telling them what the better future isHow can we attract an audience\n 273\nY ou usually do this by understanding their needs and problems and helping them realize what kind \nof future can materialize once they solve those problems Thus they can see that if they learn a given \ntechnology they can get a new job If they work if they solve a given challenge they might get a raise \nAnd by getting a new job or a raise they might improve their familys life Each person will have their \nown dreams their own goals And if you  can help them imagine and build that better future with \nyour content with the technology that youre proposing youre going to help them move toward that\nHelp them maximize the current problems\nOnce you can imagine a better future the very first thing that your brain is going to do is tell you it \nis a great future but right here right now its not so bad We dont need to move toward that better \nfuture right now Y ou can focus on the second thing you have to do which is to help them maximize \nthe current problems People not only move toward something they want but they actually move \nfaster away from something they dont want Therefore by helping them understand the current \nsituation the problems theyre going through and how bad staying where they are actually is youre \ngoing to help them want to move away from the current problems and toward this better future that \nyou help them create\nHelp build a bridge\nThe third step is to help build a bridge Because the moment they can see that there is a better place to \ngo and they cannot stay where they are theyre going to start using excuses like Oh but its too hard \nTheres no way to get there What this person did is different from what Im able to do   Its important \nto build a bridge from where the person is all the way to where they want to get to this better future \nthat they are looking for And the way to do that is by using your skills the technology that youre \nproposing and the content that youre creating to lay out a series of steps that the person can see \nthemselves taking If they take these steps then they can get to the better place youre talking about \nA good example of a series of steps is exactly what we provide here in this book\nThis book lays out 15 chapters In other words it lays out 15 steps that you can take to get an amazing \ncareer and improve your life As a leader you have to organize your content in a way that people can \nsee that if they take this series of steps if they walk that path that youre proposing they will get to \nthis amazing life that you help them create The fourth step then for people to transform their lives \nis for them to take a small action\nTake a small first step\nNow that the person can see a better future they recognize that staying where they are is not reasonable \nand they see there is a bridge between where they are and the amazing future they want to get to \nthey will start saying things like Yes thats great Ill start this tomorrow I dont need to do this right \nn o w  or I can wait for a better moment in my life to do something like this   And they will continue to \nbe stuck in whatever situation they are in right now Y ou should help them take that first small step \nbecause as soon as they start moving theres a much greater chance that they will continue to take \nmore and more steps in that direction Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 274\nBe clear  people in doubt do not take action\nOur whole objective with our content in terms of inspiring people to take action is to do these \naforementioned four things build a better place maximize their problems build a bridge to the better \nplace and then help the person take a small step so they can start walking that path And this fourth \nstep is very very important because if they represent the content they are building your brand If \nyou dont know what step people need to take to walk on that path how can someone consuming \nyour content really understand what the next step is Y ou have to be very clear to help them take this \nfirst step  and the best step that you can help them take is to build a relationship with you Once \nyou take the responsibility to attract people to you youre also taking the responsibility to create \nthis relationship between you and the person And the longer they stay with you the more they will \nconsume your content participate in your activities use your technology get involved in your project \nand join your community\nThe longer they stay close to you the more theyre going to learn and advance in their careers because \nyou have a focus a brand and youre going to continue to work in that space Y oure going to continue \nto help them This step of them building a relationship with you is extremely important  it could be \njoining a community that you are part of maybe a Discord server or a Slack channel or maybe it could \nbe to connect through social media There are all kinds of easy steps that will help people connect with \nyou And once they connect you can continue to provide  information help and support so they can \ncontinue to move on this path across this bridge that you have to help them create\nHelp them help others\nOne last thing that creates  impact is to help your audience help others We talk a lot in this book \nabout both building and participating in communities The more you can bring the people that trust \nyou into communities that youre part of then the more support theyre going to have the more they \nwill be able to help others and the larger transformation you can help them achieve Lets look at the \nvarious ways in which you can build a community from your audience\nShare their stories testimonials\nOne way is to incentivize  your audience to share their stories Its an easy way to help others by letting \nthem share their struggles the actions they took and the results they achieved All of this helps other \npeople from the community to really want to take those steps and want to be involved\nPromote an environment of support\nY ou can also promote  an environment of support Incentivize and inspire people in your community \nto support others welcome new members help them to find their way around and really be part \nof building the community Once someone joins in if they can start helping others too then they \nwill feel part of the community much faster and theyll be more inspired to continue to take action \nand participateLeveraging your personal brand professionally\n 275\nShare the successes and the results\nAnother great way to build community  is by sharing successful results from people in the community \nSo make a point to congratulate people even if they have only taken a small step\nY ou can use gamification to do that Y ou can use a point system or you can simply tell people that you \nappreciate and recognize the step theyre taking which will also go a long way toward helping them \ncontinue to take the next step and the next and the next and improve their results\nY oure also helping them work with other people in your community so they can support each other \non this path Taking action is extremely hard but if you help people take the first step and you can \nengage them inside a supportive community to help them continue to grow then youre setting them \nup to transform their own lives and improve their whole situation\nAsk for feedback\nOnce you have established  your brand attracted an audience and shared your brand ask your audience \nfor feedback This will help you to determine if you are delivering on your brand promises Delivering \non your brand promises will establish even more trust in you as a professional to be able to achieve \nyour goals Be willing to adapt your content and your messaging as needed to remain consistent with \nyour brand Create a continuous feedback loop to ensure consistent improvement and refine the \ncontent and activities you are involved in throughout your professional career Be generous in your \nappreciation of the feedback as well Feedback is a gift Create a space for people to feel safe to provide \nfeedback to you It will help you to grow and engage more deeply with your community Now lets \ndiscuss how to leverage your brand professionally\nLeveraging your personal brand professionally\nAll of this may sound  like a fulltime job of helping others and that it will not bring any benefit to \nyou and your career So lets take a look at how doing everything weve discussed can actually help \nyou professionally\nTrust leads to opportunity\nFirst of all trust is the best way to create opportunities and get amazing positions The bestpaying \nmost interesting and challenging positions in the market are offered to people that we trust When \nsomeone has an interesting position inside their company or is working on an interesting project and \nneeds help from someone they will invite someone they trust to be part of it The same thing happens \ninside companies When teams managers and developers need help to hire someone they will look \nfor people that they trust When you build trust with other developers managers and people from \ndifferent companies you increase the chance that someone that trusts you will invite you to one of \nthese amazing projects Remember that up to 75 of jobs are in what we call the hidden job market  Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 276\nThese jobs are not visible to people that are not in the circle of trust For you to get access to them you \nneed to be trusted by a greater number of people When you build your brand attract an audience \nstart to be seen as a trustworthy person then more people will suggest your name invite you to a \nhiring process and give you access to the most amazing positions in the market\nTrust is the best way to meet amazing people\nBut not only does it unlock invisible jobs  trust is also the best way to meet amazing people When \npeople trust you and become your friend you have a chance to peek inside their head Instead of you \njust seeing an amazing developer or someone far away disconnected from you you can actually have \na connection and a relationship with them With that you both share your skills knowledge and \ninsights with each other This mutually beneficial relationship makes both of you stronger allowing \nyou to tackle harder problems and more complex challenges\nSoftware development is an environment that requires far too many skills and way too many tools \nfor one person to know it all and be ready to do everything When you build relationships with more \npeople you gain access to the knowledge that you need to go after the highest challenge That will \nalso give you a lot of confidence because once you have friends and know you can reach out to them \nyoure going to be more confident and actually more open to interesting and challenging projects \nThis confidence will allow you to work much better in your current project even if you dont ask for \nhelp So building trust with a larger community of professional developers will help you become a \nmuch better developer by itself Last but not least trust is also the  best way for you to lead people\nTrust is the best way to lead people\nIf you want to grow beyond senior positions to positions with more responsibility and autonomy you \nrequire a leadership mentality And the best way for you to be seen as a leader and really help people \nachieve results and work together as a team is when you are a trustworthy person By building your \nbrand attracting people and being that trusted advisor that people around you believe and trust \nyoure going to position yourself to have a larger influence and more responsibilities With that you \ncan take on more leadership positions  not necessarily a manager position if you dont want that but \neven that could be a reality Every position beyond the senior level is a position that requires some \nlevel of leadership and influence on both the team and the wider company The more you build trust \nwith people around you the more you will be prepared for those positions with both your confidence \nand the network to get invited to those positions Therefore building your brand is a great way for \nyou to attract the best people in the market and the best jobs in the market\nSaying this it sounds like we built our brand only for our own selfish purposes of wanting to grow \nBut in reality the only way for you to be a leader is when you stop thinking only about yourself and \nstart taking responsibility to help others to achieve what they want Its a winwin situation when you \ntake the responsibility to attract people to you Y ou help them achieve results and success and that \nwill bring back results for your careerLeveraging your personal brand professionally\n 277\nWhen you are ready to interview for a new role either at your existing company or at a new company \nthere are some things to consider If you

community of likeminded peers When you are ready to take the \nnext step in your career sometimes you will not want to make it widely known to others but there are \nsome times when you may unexpectedly be looking for a new role and it will make sense to share the \nnews broadly and make your intentions known At some point in your career you will find yourself in \nboth these situations or maybe even decide that you want to strike out on your own to be your own \nboss and start your own company either solo or as part of a team This section will prepare you for \nany of these

with the process of resume writing Some \nthings to suggest are to not make it too long dont use the first person and make sure to have \na section that lists all relevant technologies with your levels of expertise\n Recruiters  Use recruiters to help you stand out from the crowd With online job listings and \njob boards you are like a grain of sand or a needle in a haystack Y ou can initially locate jobs \nthrough online listings and job boards but then go further and find recruiters to make the \nintroductions for you\n Use your network  Reach out to your contacts in companies where you would like to work \nAsk them for personal introductions or referrals to open positions\n Online tools  LinkedIn is a powerful tool When you are looking for a new position take a \nfresh look and clean up your online profiles adding your most recent accomplishments Add \na summary of your skills and achievements Use tools such as OneNote to help you keep track \nof your meetings and contacts Y ou are going to meet a lot of people on your hunt OneNote \nhas sections for todos interviews training and so on and you can use Ctrl  1 to create and \ntoggle checkboxes\n Practice

interview questions Baseline questions such as Tell us a little bit \nabout yourself   and What do you know about the role  etc Skills and Experience questions that \nallow you to share your knowledge and experience technical interview questions Leadership \nquestions that highlight your leadership abilities whether through being a direct manager \nor not  this allows you to demonstrate your potential to lead internally and externally and \nfinally CulturalBehavioral when you share your successes and failures and your abilities to \nresolve conflicts manage time and priorities and work

to work for your career advancement\nInterview\nYolande Poirier\nMy name is Y olanda Poirier and I currently am working at Neo4J Im in charge of the community \nthere globally but particularly in the US Im responsible for meetups websites forums  you could \ncall it community but thats a fancy word  everything that touches developer communities and data \nscience Also the champion program We have a Discord account for example We are running an \nonline conference in the fall which Im also involved with both promotion and the Call for Papers \nIm part of DevRel which is really nice as well because my counterparts are technical and they help us \nwith all the initiatives So thats very nice And Ive been doing all of this for quite a while as you know\nQ So this is my question Y ouve been working with communities for quite a while How did you get \nstarted How did you get involved with communities and working with branding marketing and \nDevRel all of this\nA I think a lot of people come through the meetups but first you need to have some passion for \ncommunities for organizing events Doing that in your free time definitely helps People have different \nprofiles and in my case I do community but I also work very closely with marketing I was always \nin a marketing department Some people are in a smaller company for example so they may come \nfrom engineering and start with the forum making sure that people answer questions Sometimes \nthey will run beta programs for example Thats a very different profile It really depends on the size \nof the company how it is structured All those departments are also structured differently When \nI was at Oracle it was engineering DevRel was more in engineering and I was part of marketing \nbut I had to go back and forth So you need to wear multiple hats thats for sure I found what was \nreally helpful for me was to understand the different roles and responsibilities in the organization \nSo understanding what engineers do how the product is being developed whats the cycle but also \nhow corporate marketing works how events are structured who is responsible for what and even \nbranding as well because branding also has rules There are also legal needs to be involved at some \npoint So its really wearing multiple hats which I really love\nQ Y ou mentioned how people can get into this but how did you get started How did you get involved \nI love what you just said at the end there that you loved wearing multiple hats Can you elaborate on \nthis How did you get started wearing multiple hats Did you always do that\nA Actually I started at Sun Microsystems in product marketing from all places on Java And you \nprobably know a little product called JavaFX Well a long time ago I started on that And similarly \nproduct marketing can be structured differently because my role was not very technical It was more \noutward facing with more promotional aspects So that was also a little bit different There was an Interview\n 279\ninbound and outbound marketing function but it wasnt very engineering focused so to speak As part \nof that role I definitely had to understand everything And then from there I moved to an organization \nthat dealt with cloud computing in the early days And again there were developer initiatives and \nsome products to work on as well And I stayed in those developer roles for quite a while actually I \nwas on student initiatives you name it all of which was similar but very different at the same time \nDifferent players different activities different people to deal with\nQ One of the things that a professional is always worried about is the whole thing that you just \nmentioned about wearing too many hats Lots of people are worried about how many things they \nneed to learn how many technologies they need to understand how many things they need to do \nHow do you handle that How do you handle knowing lots of people lots of different things lots of \ndifferent skills that you have to have to work on all these things \nA I think this is something were all almost always struggling with that because you feel like you dont \nknow enough which is probably true I think its knowing how much depth you need to understand \nin order to be effective because you have to understand the communities you have to be able to talk \nwith technical people Y ou need to understand the key technologies Making sure that you have some \nsystem to understand what your company is doing and how it fits with the rest of the ecosystem  \nthats a must There is no way you can bypass that And for several reasons you need to understand \nthe community that youre going after I mean where are the touchpoints with those communities \nAnd so the more you know about the technology and other related technologies the better There \nare also opportunities for events Also as a community manager you always find yourself mentoring \nothers Y ou may find somebody who is motivated to talk about your product but doesnt know really \nhow they can actually fit into what youre doing So its like a puzzle a constant puzzle with moving \npieces that you need to figure out because otherwise you cant really help people\nIf you see a person very quickly you need to understand who this person is Are they a backend \ndeveloper or a frontend developer What are they interested in Are they interested in blogging \nspeaking What are their strengths Y ou have to empower people And sometimes they know who \nthey are sometimes they dont So you have to be quick to identify that as well And also whenever \npossible make sure that you connect them with the right people so they can also actually move forward \nin their career in having fun all of that Y ou have to think fast I think thats what has always helped \nY ou meet someone and you say okay I know what kind of person that is And sometimes you get it \nwrong and thats okay too But I think at least trying to help people grow in your community is key \nDont get me wrong I love people who are at the top of their field and are champions They produce \ncontent they are keynote speakers Those people are fantastic in your community\nSo Im not really worried about those people I just open doors I just say Oh there is an event here \nWhat would you like to do  So I just support them And usually its with a program or with money \nif we have money So thats easy To me thats the easy part The more complex and more fun thing is \nhelping more people to be successful via the community that youre building So its about going to \nconferences and figuring out how people are learning about your product what tools they can use \nhow easy can you make it for them to use your product Anything that works for that is gold because \nthen you can really grow your community So thats fun And you can also then mentor those people \nwho are champions to also become mentors with you when you see certain opportunities Build Your Personal Brand and Become a Trusted Advisor 280\nQ Just as a side note here I believe in exactly what you said about empowering people so they can \nmove forward and find their own path I found it fascinating how you described that because thats \nexactly what I believe So thats awesome But I think that ties in very well with branding Y ouve been \na person who has helped other people Y ou mentioned those top people in the industry how youve \nhelped them find and build their own brands When you mentor people you also help them do the \nsame thing So what do you think branding is for developers What is a personal brand Because \none thing  Im not sure if youve had this experience  but one thing that I have seen a lot is that \ndevelopers come to me and say Look I dont want to promote myself   When you talk about branding \nwith them they imagine theyre promoting themselves and they dont want to do this Why do you \nthink thats important\nA First of all when I do a workshop the first question I usually ask is does anybody here have a \nbrand Even the way I phrase the sentence is a total sap because of course most people say no Im like \nwell yes you do have a brand No matter who you are you show up you have a presence you have \na brand People will use whatever shortcut they can and will label you in one way or another So the \nquestion is do you have control over or can you influence how people see you Or if you think that \nyou dont really care well would you show up naked to a party Well maybe not right Because that \nwouldnt be comfortable So that means that youre aware that you make an impression And I think \nthats what a brand is Of course when we think about brands we think about the big brands such as \nNike and celebrities and so forth Well the truth is that we all have a brand so we have to work on it \nAnd nobody is fully comfortable with it ever I dont know I mean Im certainly not\nSummary\nIn this chapter you learned key marketing concepts about branding how to define your own style \nand attract your audience how to apply simple marketing concepts to your own brand how to \nattract the right people that you can help and how to use your brand to get amazing internal and \nexternal opportunities\nSo here you have it a full Masterplan for the Developer Career It may look overwhelming right now \nbut every step listed in the book can be done in small first and then grow when you have results \nAlso there is no need to do it all at once Y our developer career is an infinite game keep working on \nit and it will always improve and grow\nThere is just one thing that can prevent this book from helping you  not taking action\nY ou can do small things Y ou can do just a few things Y ou can even decide not to do some or even \nmany of them Y et if you dont take action on any of the things we showed you here nothing will \nhappen to your career\nWe hope that you will take action And if you need help follow us on social media and we will do \nour best to guide you on the right path\nThank you and congratulations\nHeather VanCura heathervc\nBruno Souza brjavamanIndex\nB\nbrand audience\nattracting
